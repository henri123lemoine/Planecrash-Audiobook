Osirion is not particularly sympathetic to any falsehoods about afterlives but falsely telling people Hell isn't very bad is well over the line.)</p>\n<p><br/>Carissa Sevar is bound (in a modesty-respecting fashion, with three cloaks draped over her in case anyone would find the ropes sensuous, so she resembles a very beautiful head poking out of a burrito), and gagged, and her guards are deaf, and she's in an antimagic field, and the handcuffs she's wearing were Polymorphed into a solid stone block with an eight circle spell that is, importantly, permanent rather than instantaneous, which means that if she's somehow gets out of the antimagic field the spell will cease to be suppressed and they'll sever both her hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br/>Furthermore they have used the spell Touch of Idiocy to temporarily reduce her Intelligence to 9, which will kick in if she leaves the antimagic field so she can't cast spells.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br/>The head of the Risen Guard has warned the pharaoh that he doesn't actually consider this adequate security. Artifact headbands out of Hell can ignore antimagic fields, and the headband has some spells built in; the only ones he can see are Banishment and a used True Seeing, but artifact headbands are also known to not always reliably report their capabilities. If she has Major Image and Gaseous Form and Greater Restoration in there, all their precautions are for naught. And if Hell planned this, Hell planned for Osirion's obvious precautions.\u00a0</p></div>",

Or rather, I think you can, with enough Wisdom, do that thing to yourself anyway without actually having someone to talk to, but talking to someone will be faster, and I think we don't have all the time in the world -</p>\n<p>- anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think Keltham's going to try to kill Asmodeus, and I think Asmodeus is going to let Rovagug out to eat Golarion. Because He's the god of pride, and He hates losing, and He - sucks, actually, he's horrible, I genuinely cannot comprehend that I heard that prophecy about how He'd <em>end the world if he didn't like it enough </em>and still thought He could possibly be worth serving -</p>\n<p><br/>- anyway - He'd rather end the world than be defeated by the worthless little worms that someone gave free will.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br/>Of course if Otolmens knew how this would go she'd squish Keltham. Not just Her. \u00a0Achaekek eats people who are on a trajectory to threaten the gods, maybe he can't get into the Dome. Or He could but He'd have to, like, chisel his way in, which seems kind of beneath His dignity. I - thought about warning Otolmens, when I realized, but -</p>\n<p>- but I couldn't just - give up, on all the space that there is here for something to be\u00a0<em>better,\u00a0</em>and I couldn't give up on Keltham, condemn him to be - deleted - and Cheliax would conquer the world, if Otolmens just took Keltham out, and I don't think Cheliax should do that actually -</p>\n<p>And I think that the Good gods - well, Cayden Cailean, though I'm confused about why it'd just be Him, and suspect it isn't - I think that they're trying to see if there's - a way for Keltham and Asmodeus to negotiate something that Asmodeus prefers to destroying the world. All the interventions on the Project - they weren't aimed at Keltham, his trajectory wasn't very changeable. There was nothing we could realistically have shown Keltham such that, when he learned about Hell, he wasn't like 'wow I'm going to kill the guy in charge of that'. They were aimed at, well, me, and at Pilar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's the most Asmodean thing in the world, in a way, to kill your boss because you want His job. I think Good's angling for some kind of defeat of Asmodeus which - which is Asmodean enough, if that makes any sense at all, that he prefers it to unleashing Rovagug. It's what I was trying for, from a different angle. My compact - there are some conditions on that, it's going to be hard to use, but - it's what I was trying to do, follow the rules and do the thing Asmodeus respects and also make Hell less stupidly horrible - although I'm not sure Good objects to the same things about it I do -\"</p></div>",

I'm pretty sure, now, that it was never that, just like Cayden Cailean absolutely was not collaborating with Asmodeus because Asmodeus's victory was inevitable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But - if you look at where they've been intervening, what their interventions have achieved -</p>\n<p>Pilar. Kind of suspect some strings were pulled, to make sure she was in the initial group. She's weirder than any of the other girls - you'd be less likely to have one like her, in a group of twenty promising Asmodean wizard students - or for that matter a group of a thousand - Nethys and Cayden arranged for her to go to Elysium and come back still an Asmodean. They arranged for her to have incredibly bizarre powers that are like nothing I've ever heard of, that are like a game only it's never been clear what they're trying to achieve. They put what must have been an obscene amount of effort and intervention budget into helping her find the new ilani, who are picking it up really quickly - it turns out that Chelish people make worse students -</p>\n<p>And me. If I'd figured out at the very beginning that Asmodeus won't, actually, refrain from annihilating people if it happens to be convenient, I'd have gone to Iomedae, probably, unless She sucks more than advertised which She might. I'm undecided on whether she's with Cayden and pretending not to be, not with Cayden because She is willing to tolerate more risk of the world being destroyed in exchange for not having to compromise with Asmodeus than Him in which case fuck Her, or not with Cayden because She's not okay with the very real possibility we fuck up and the world gets eaten by Rovagug, here, in which case She's good enough and I'd just Atone. ...I'm pretty sure I could Atone. I don't especially want to but I do hate the person who did literally all of the things I've done with my entire life and want that person turned into a paving stone, which seems like the right attitude.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br/>Anyway. Instead of cheaply telling me at the start 'hey, here's how many souls got annihilated in Hell last year', a lot of things more expensive than that to the gods have happened. Asmodeus told me to try to be corrupted and Aspexia and Abrogail and Subirachs and Maillol worked really hard on that and they shaped who I am today, and I'd try to undo that on the grounds that it was hostile interference in my personality and values except that I think maybe my being more and properly Asmodean was part of the plan. I think maybe I'm supposed to ascend and become a Power in Hell and fix it, in line with the terms already established for how I can do that, except interpreted some clever twisty way Asmodeus didn't see coming.</p>\n<p><br/>It's so much steering - such costly steering - I think they're aiming for a very small target, which is to say I think they have some probability of missing their target, which is\u00a0<em>terrifying\u00a0</em>given the stakes, but -\"</p></div>",

Are the statues that decorate Dis fine as long as they're not conscious?\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Would <em>Carissa </em>accept a solution that involves lots of people not being conscious? </span>How do you fix a paving stone? Would Dispater participate in a scheme to overthrow Asmodeus and give Carissa His throne, if it was a good enough scheme?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Would she be a good Lawful Evil god?</p>\n<p>- No, wrong question, the best Lawful Evil god is whoever successfully acquires, and keeps, authority over Lawful Evil. It's like the claim that a nice thing about Asmodeanism is that if your superior says you did a good job you know you did a good job, which claim turned out not to be true because your superiors might just not care about what you care about. If you're in charge, you know you're supposed to be in charge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why does she have a cult? Is the cult part of the plan? Should she be actively encouraging her cult? How does one actively encourage a cult? ...actually she's totally been doing that, with Abrogail's help, at the party and in her address to Project Lawful where she halfheartedly condemned the rumors of heresy. Was that strategic, or was she just doing it out of thoughtless amusement? The Ascendant Three - does that mean anything, or is it just another bit of silliness in the Egorian rumor mill?</p>\n<p>- actually, how much of what she heard bubbling in the Egorian rumor mill was silly?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What did Keltham and Abadar sever ties over, if it\u00a0<em>wasn't\u00a0</em>a plan to overthrow Asmodeus? ....actually, when Keltham severed ties with Abadar, he couldn't have been expecting Carissa'd be in a position to play any useful part in his plans. So what was he planning at the time? What did she<em> realize,</em> the first time she sat and thought without her mind being read, that set her on this course, that drove her to sell her soul - was it just that she was on the wrong side -</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

My impression of Dispater is that He enjoys indulging me, if it's not obviously stupid, if it grants Him pride and respect in Hell, and I've already had as much benefit as I can from that in my current position but if I did something epic and impressive, He'd be willing to indulge me again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the Worldwound doesn't work I could instead seize Cheliax, which proves my Asmodean bona fides all right and which I feel less averse to now that I know this entire situation is Abrogail's fault more than I already thought it was. That doesn't count towards my conquests but it does count towards how cool Dispater thinks I am. And if neither of those work I could probably start actually conquering other countries, except if I do that I have responsibilities to everyone in them so we'd have to be really sure of subsequent steps of the plan.</p>\n<p>Anyway, once I had a impressive track record as rising Power-of-Hell, I'd bring a confidential negotiation, tell Dispater I intend to overthrow Asmodeus, and see what He says. He's not bound to obey Asmodeus and He runs Dis - not well enough, but closer to not being stupidly wasteful, He'd be <em>willing\u00a0</em>to run it in an acceptable way,\u00a0<em>He\u00a0</em>wouldn't destroy the world about the rules changing. And He's, you know, a devil, He respects strength and He respects trying to rise to your place. I think He'd help me if there were something compelling in it for Him. I think at INT 29 I can compact with Him safely.</p>\n<p>I am assuming here that you have some fraction of a plan to kill Asmodeus already, because none of what you're doing makes any sense if you don't. But I am assuming that it's a bad plan that runs unacceptable-to-me risks and we might need to think of a better one. In particular, I'm worried you just - don't mind - that Asmodeus might release Rovagug - uh, it's reassuring, you saying you don't want to kill people, I'd gotten scared that you'd just decided to - be ilani and clean up this whole messy little bit of reality -</p>\n<p>- but, uh, I'm not helping with a plan where Asmodeus might release Rovagug. I want to fix the world, not be worse than any Evil ever to scour it.\"</p></div>",

I didn't do my end of that. I'll explain why in a second. You're not going to do your end of that.</p>\n<p>We will trade with each other like mortals with different goals who are, being mortal and hating each other and being in a ton of pain, very likely to end up assuming our goals are more different than they actually are, and who are actively correcting for that by trying really hard to mind the interests of the other and pass up on chances to destroy each other to our benefit even though they're wildly more appealing than continuing to try. I don't know if there's a god of that. I do think if that's not what we're aiming at then we're completely fucked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two.</p>\n<p>You want to destroy the universe if you can't get it remade to your satisfaction. I, obviously, think that's incredibly horrible of you; I distrust everything I learned from you, and from dath ilan, because I feel very fundamentally that if this is the product of those values then I don't want them inside me and don't want them shaping me. But I didn't, when I first realized that was what you wanted, report you and get you squished; I sold my soul to protect the Project girls and come here with - thirty Wishes, I tried for, thirty Wishes and two headbands. I understand my reasons, now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's maybe a hundred billion people? So I should be willing to risk a one in a hundred billion chance of destroying the universe for anything for which I'd be willing to go to Axis, grab a person out of the incredible joyous brilliant meaningful life they've spent the last ten thousand years building, and feed them to daemons while they begged me for mercy. It would take a lot to get me to do that. But - I'd do it to fix Hell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't ask me how many people I'd grab from Axis and feed to daemons to fix Hell. I don't know but it's not many, not anywhere near enough to close the gap between us. But I'm not trying to close the gap between us; I'm not trying to ally with you. I am trying to use you to fix Hell and fix Abaddon and fix the current state of affairs where Asmodeus, and maybe other gods, are holding in reserve an option to destroy the world. I am, I think, feeding some people to daemons, in expectation, when I use you for that. I hate that. I hate you, for being someone I can only use by feeding people to daemons. But I don't have the option of using someone\u00a0<em>else.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Also I'm really scared at this point that even if they squish you, the universe doesn't have another thousand years in it, in a configuration this unstable. We've got to fix it into something that no one has the power to destroy and that very few value-systems that are floating around all over the place would\u00a0<em>want\u00a0</em>to destroy. We've got to build our own Civilization.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And - and there are people praying to me.</p>\n<p>I think, if there were two universes, and in one of them I fed them to daemons by accident, trying to answer their prayers, and in the other one they came to me in Hell and were safe and found mercy - and I told them that the price of that mercy was that in the other universe I'd fed them to daemons, trying my best - I think a lot of them would forgive me, I think a lot of them would be glad -</p>\n<p>If there were ten universes -</p>\n<p>- the numbers don't cohere yet. Probably the numbers will cohere when I'm smarter. But that's where I'm at, that's why I haven't killed myself or Banished myself or Gated out or done a Sending to Ri-Dul, because, when my numbers don't cohere, and when I don't get another chance, and I have to just go with my best guess about what I can do here and I lose options every minute, I think I'm supposed to try to fix things, not to try to kick the can down the road until someone who agrees with you succeeds.</p>\n<p>And I'm willing to commit to that, I'm willing to promise you that I'll stay here trying to use you to fix the world instead of trying to warn someone you're going to crush it. But I want you to promise <em>me\u00a0</em>that you'll\u00a0<em>let\u00a0</em>me do that, that I'll have the freedom and autonomy to pursue the ideas I come up with for alternatives to destroying the world, that I'll be able to do whatever makes sense for ensuring Asmodeus would rather live in the world we're demanding than destroy it, and Pharasma would rather live in the world we're demanding than destroy it, and that I'll be allowed to make myself smarter, and that I'll be allowed to potentially compact with Dispater and potentially compact with Cheliax and potentially call in Pilar and do the other things I might need to do.</p></div>",

The gods are very unlikely to be able to do it, no matter what agreements exist among them; the best it seems remotely likely we'll be able to get from them is an agreement not to stop us from doing it. A lot of the things that make peoples' lives good and interesting and valuable\u00a0<em>aren't actually things that can be granted by divine miracle anyway.\u00a0</em>And this is not going to be the last threat to the multiverse, and we can't plan on solving every single situation with someone trying to personally ascend and threaten to destroy the universe, I doubt we make it through three more crises that way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So - Civilization. I could be wrong that Golarion is by far the strongest contender for where to do it, but I don't think I am. We know a lot more about where to start building a Civilization of humans than a civilization of anything else. Golarion has a bunch of ascended formerly human gods; from what you said earlier, it sounds like they're pretty sharply local. I should expect once I ascend I'll be at least somewhat local, at least for the first few thousand years, as will Pilar if she ascends, as will anyone else we ascend if we kill Achaekek and it turns out to be the case that with Him dead there's a substantial waiting store of suitable people for it. Losing Golarion makes things\u00a0<em>much much worse\u00a0</em>on the scale of the next couple thousand years, and I think likely means something bad happens to Creation before we can dig ourselves out of that trough and get back to where we'd have been if we didn't lose Golarion.</p>\n<p>That is, of course, also an objection to the Rovagug plan, but I actually am immediately coming up with enough ideas there to be tentatively optimistic. I think if we play our cards just right, we make Asmodeus commit Himself fully to destroying Rovagug in time to save Golarion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think it's interesting that, when I said I thought the Worldwound was important, you instantly assumed I couldn't comprehend the stakes and had just decided reasonlessly to worry about a minor problem on a planet you intended to have eaten anyway, instead of, you know, asking me 'under what assumptions does the Worldwound matter'? I think you did that because you have never fundamentally respected me, never fundamentally respected <em>anyone on this planet</em>, believe that you alone are capable of reason.</p>\n<p>Your <em>failure of perspective-taking on that</em> reflects a general type of reasoning error where, if you commit it with respect to Pharasma and decision theory instead of myself and utility functions, you will definitely get everybody in the multiverse killed unnecessarily. I didn't promise not to give you orders, so, grow the fuck up.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>She's not really in the mood for chocolates.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><br/>She's in the mood to collapse dramatically on the floor and wonder if she should, in fact, have, immediately betrayed Keltham to Otolmens who would crush him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is not an important question to answer, in one sense. She can't do it now. The error, if it was an error, was made due to intense time pressure and incomplete information about her past self's plans and panic and the risk of being mindread and love for Keltham and guilt over having harmed him so badly and existential horror at the thought of him being casually annihilated for a thought he might not even in fact be thinking, and she doesn't exactly think she'll make similar errors in the future. She's sure never ever ever going to love anyone again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The obvious analysis here is that yes, she should have immediately betrayed Keltham, or at least have refused to step out of the Dome until she had his promise she could oppose him if she saw fit, which he wouldn't have given, at which point she'd have betrayed him to Otolmens.</p>\n<p>(Why does it even come to her to betray him to Otolmens? How is Otolmens not carefully watching the situation already! Wasn't Broom supposed to be handling this?)</p>\n<p>(Broom, who Osirion freed because they don't enslave halflings. It would serve everyone right, in some sense, certainly serve Otolmens and Cheliax right, if Broom, freed, decided to go travel the world or buy a house or something. Or maybe he's here, and just hoping he won't have to stab Keltham. Either way, if Keltham isn't worrying about Broom Carissa won't bring the possibility to his attention).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The less-obvious analysis here is that this way, she might be able to talk Keltham into a version of his plan that is actually better than the status quo, and it all depends on the probabilities, which she's poorly equipped to even begin to estimate. But Snack Service thought something good could happen here, something for which Carissa mattered and Carissa's status in Hell mattered, and -</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>- she thinks everything Cayden/Nethys has done has made this harder for Keltham to pull off? Otolmens picking Broom in the first place was a response to Pilar and Ione being picked; She's paying the situation closer attention. Nefreti said that the deception would've gone on longer without Cayden/Nethys's interventions, and if that's so, then when Keltham departed he'd have been richer, and Cheliax been less impaired in pursuing him, and he wouldn't have had the prospect of his children rushing him to solve this prematurely, they'd already have existed.....</p>\n<p>If Cayden and Nethys were aiming at the destruction of the world they could have probably done it, from this starting point. So they're aiming at something else. And - she's not sure this logic is valid, but it does feel like probably if she were the kind of person who Nethys knew would instantly report Keltham, then some other person meets Keltham where he lands instead, some person who doesn't feel so strongly about the world not ending -</p>\n<p>This is, perhaps, a question to return to when she's a god. If she's a god. She sure is making a lot of plans premised on her godhood, lately, for someone who does not in fact possess godhood and is actually just a fifth circle wizard with more money than fifth circle wizards usually have.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perhaps she is staring at this because for all that it hurts, it doesn't hurt as much as staring inward and figuring out who she is and what she isn't and what she's done.</p></div>",

But anyway, outside a place like this, if you ask people how they feel about that, they're all appalled. If you ask them if they wish we'd let the daemons go back to doing that, they're terrified. They don't want that at all. Now, Keltham would point out, once people go to Hell, they often want to die. But I guess I figure - if pretty much no one wants the River of Souls fed to Abaddon, then even if some of them after they go to Hell do want that, they don't get to have the other people not in Hell murdered on their behalf. I'd feel differently about that if there were a sizable contingent of people who did wish all souls got eaten when you die. And there's not none - some Rovagug cultists showed up to join Keltham, they're mostly like that - but it's a really unusual stance, much rarer than going to Hell is.\"</p></div>",

But - well, two things.</p>\n<p>One is that many of the other decisions I've made in the last two days are also giving myself into your hands a lot more than that, and I don't see a difference between Splendour and putting on your earring and swearing not to work against your plans and giving you wishes - like, they all might be bad to the extent they let you achieve your goals at my expense, and good to the extent they make things better. I am guessing that to you, Splendour feels different because it's more like modifying your priorities than constraining you, but I think that to me, at least, maybe to most people who haven't had dath ilani training - both of those end up modifying you, everything modifies you, to be in someone's life is to change which parts of you grow and which get squished, and all you can do is choose people who bring out parts of you that you like.</p>\n<p>I suspect now that I say that that there's a Keeper art of not being altered by having done something you were selected to do randomly, being the same person as the version of you who wasn't selected to do it but would have, but it's not one of those I think I should be trying to pick up right now. I don't have enough of a self to defend. And the one true real conviction that I do have - that people who want to live should not be annihilated - I genuinely don't think you could talk me out of that with 50 Splendour.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two is that just like you can trade with Asmodeus if you're Abadar, you can just price in that He'll be trading adversarially, and so you can talk to someone who has Splendour and just correct for the Splendour. I like Abrogail and that's probably mostly the Splendour and I can in fact set it aside and kill her if that's strategic. I like Dispater and that's definitely the Splendour and I can set that aside if we think of some other way to reach a confidentiality agreement with Erecura where the fact of talking to her won't itself be suspicious. I believe myself broadly competent to correct for liking you and for you trying to be persuasive to me, and where I'm not perfect, I'm also not perfect at - correcting for being mad at you or for hating you or for being scared of you, and hating you and being scared of you makes it harder to think and so is worse.\"</p></div>",

I don't know if the official statistics are true but I think we had substantially lower losses than average. But Project Lawful was too weird, too confusing, and - required higher Intelligence, probably - the first night we slept together, when I told you I wanted to see a priest, I went to him with a question about whether -</p>\n<p>- my recall may not be perfect but I think I was trying to ask whether, if I slept with you, as I wanted to, and then later you learned that you weren't <em>unaware of subtle Chelish signals of people not wanting to sleep with you,\u00a0</em>you were just, the way things go in Golarion, <em>not supposed to care,\u00a0</em>then you'd be furious with me for sleeping with you, even though I did want to - because we couldn't lie about the fundamental fact that most people in Golarion have sex they don't want sometimes, it was obviously entangled with too many other things, and if we weren't going to lie to you about that then it might be that we needed to tell you before anyone had sex with you -</p>\n<p>- and he said to me that if I understood what I'd just asked I'd have to be the one to figure out an answer, because he did not understand what I'd just asked, and then after some further discussion had me ask Abarco and then told me I was in charge of trying to maximize the amount of time before you got fed up and left us. And that's how it ended up my job.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then later, in Egorian, he got tortured very badly for a mistake that he made that I still don't completely understand and was - having a hard time exercising ambitious initiative about the project, visibly so, so I told him I wanted Project Lawful to not have torture beyond what was in Taldor, as an experiment to see if that let people think, and he didn't agree to do it but he told me I could ask the Most High to put me in charge. So I did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No one especially tried to undermine me about that. They'd have been enormously rewarded if they could legitimately do better, of course, but it was obviously a very hard job, and it's not like the rewards weren't also very high for being my second-in-command. I wouldn't've crushed someone who looked like they could grow up to be genuinely better than me, that could've made us lose. I really didn't want us to lose, and I also don't like - people who are under my command - being weaker than they could be - that was why the low-punishments rule, I thought maybe they'd grow like we needed them to...</p>\n<p>In hindsight the rumor mill was probably doing a lot for me, and additionally I think it was visible that Abrogail Thrune had taken lots of personal interest in the Project and no sane person wants to come to her attention in the context of a Project they might fuck up, not if they can avoid it.</p>\n<p>When I was being punished for your departure there was a lot of angling to take over the project but it was mostly Abarco and Avaricia gambling I wouldn't come back .... I did torture them. Not so much for trying to compete with me as for driving Asmodia to suicide.

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>In Pharasma's Creation there are many people who don't want to exist and do not have a good way to achieve this. The overwhelming majority of those are in Hell, but probably there are also some in Abaddon and the Abyss and maybe the Maelstrom and the dungeons of various people on Golarion and planets like Golarion, plus some who are suffering and uncertain enough about their afterlife not to kill themselves despite having access to the option. They often suffer slowly in a way that changes who they are as people and means that even if at some point they stop being conscious, a version of them that landed on another planet at that point would not be very much like the person they were before they suffered so much.</p>\n<p>This is bad under approximately every conceivable value system. Under the value system most common in dath ilan, where everyone has thought about ethics a lot more and some people are smarter, this is so bad that killing approximately 9 people whose lives are eternal and good in order to prevent one person from suffering in this way is clearly justified. Dath ilani would practically all agree on this.\u00a0<br/><br/>It is true that people in Golarion mostly don't see it that way when they are not in Hell, but they mostly try to avoid thinking about it, and might believe false things about it. Hell lies relentlessly about what sends you there and what it's like. People in Cheliax mostly fear Hell and try not to think about it; people in other places do move mountains to avoid it. Lots of Lawful Evil people, in private, will admit that they are scared. The fact they don't atone or don't try to be Chaotic is about their suppressing thoughts of how they'll go to Hell in abject terror, not about their actual preference. Even if someone prefers Hell to nonexistence, once they've been in Hell for a little while they'll almost definitely change their mind. Even if someone does things that condemn them to Hell for the sake of protecting their children, so that their children will get to eternity in Axis instead of being eaten in Abaddon, they'll regret that choice and wish they'd chosen differently approximately as soon as Hell actually starts on them. Even if they don't for a hundred years, they will in a thousand years; even if they don't for a thousand years, they will in a hundred thousand years. People on Golarion don't know how to think about those scales. Hell deliberately discourages thinking on those scales. And it's hard to understand how bad Hell is until you are actually being tortured there; it is not a fact you can know any other way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any viable plan to fix Hell, where nearly all but not all of this suffering is located, probably incurs some risk of killing everyone in the multiverse. The plan that incurs the least risk of that is probably destroying Avernus so that further people cannot go to Hell, which would not necessarily be permanent. The plans that are most definitely permanent, like killing Asmodeus and taking His job or trying to force Pharasma to change the rules of Her Creation, incur a quite high risk of this. Plans to kill Asmodeus and take His job are probably more than 50% likely to result in His releasing Rovagug, which is probably at least 20% likely to destroy the universe and 80% likely to destroy Golarion, which may or may not be important for building Civilization within Pharasma's Creation.</p>\n<p>Plans to force Pharasma to change the rules of Her Creation will, if they fail, fail either by Pharasma laughing at Keltham and crushing him in which case no improvements to the universe at all will be achieved, or in the entire universe being destroyed, possibly by Yog-Sothoth or something in an existentially horrifying Hell-like slow-personality-death way. Failure modes like that are very unlikely. If they succeed they might change not just Hell but also significant features of other planes that have a high rate of petitioners there being very unhappy or being eaten.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pharasma does not particularly share human values, and a universe run on rules set by Keltham would be much nicer for humans and similar kinds of mortals to live in, or not exist at all if making a universe that's substantially nicer to live in is not possible within these constraints.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Keltham experienced dying, he experienced showing up in Golarion. All people, when their soul is permanently deleted from existence, should anticipate having the experience of waking up somewhere else like he did. In the typical case this will not be worse than the lives that those people are currently living in Golarion. In particular the percentage of people who will turn out to have moment-of-death copies that are slaves who cannot suicide, or in Hell dimensions, or in incomprehensible conditions that alter their cognition as they kill them, is very low. The fact this is true means that being killed is much less bad than it would be if there were not copies of you in other places some of whom will remember the moment of your death. The fact this is true also means it is better to kill someone instantaneously than for them to die in a slow way that alters their personality and values, because if they die instantaneously then they'll experience continuity with a copy of them elsewhere which hasn't already changed in a way that changes their identity as a person.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is undesirable that people will never see their families again, be separated from their children and husbands and wives, lose everything they have and were working towards, etc., but the undesirability of this is much much much smaller than the undesirability of Hell. It is probably not the case that most people would readily risk Hell to be present for their childrens' infancy and childhood, and if they say they would it is probably because they are underestimating the badness of Hell. Also under the present system many people are separated from their loved ones permanently anyway, and an ideal fix to Pharasma's Creation would improve the world along this metric.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is not bad that people will exist about a billion times less, because it doesn't subjectively feel like anything to exist, and is not part of most human value systems in dath ilan. Those people who think it is part of their value systems would almost always reconsider if they could discuss the matter with a Keeper.</p>\n<p>The gods as they are currently situated seem likely to stop any planet in Pharasma's Creation from building Civilization, or at least likely to stop it from spreading its discoveries to the rest of Pharasma's Creation. It seems reasonably likely that they're only presently allowing the scientific revolution because they don't see where it's headed. In the absence of intervention to change the rules and ensure Civilization is allowed to come about, it seems possible the inhabited planets within Creation will either persist for a very long time not being much better as a place to live, or else get destroyed the first time they get far enough out of equilibrium some gods want them gone, or else get destroyed by dath ilan or some force like it that is trying to maximize average happiness of instantiated minds across the multiverse. If that is a common value, which it probably is because everyone in dath ilan is very smart and it was approximately universal there, and if Pharasma's Creation is as vulnerable to destruction as it looks, then Pharasma's Creation is going to get destroyed sooner or later unless someone brings average quality of life there above a reasonable estimate of how bad the greater multiverse is.</p>\n<p>Pharasma is fundamentally the kind of entity who has no business running a multiverse, and so it is good, other things equal, to make her stop that, and it is worth at least some small probability of the multiverse being destroyed to wrest control of it from an alien entity that does not share human values unless Greater Reality is even worse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the policy 'destroy bits of Greater Reality that you are not glad you landed in' is followed by all people waking up in unfamiliar universes, then maybe in the long run everyone who wakes up in an unfamiliar universe will wake up in a pretty good one, so the repeat application of this process makes it more and more of a good idea over time. The fact dath ilani were taught to think about the world this way, including game theory about cleaning up bits of Greater Reality you find yourself in where Zon-Kuthon asks for 10gp, suggests that dath ilan may already have calculated this is a good idea.\u00a0</p></div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Guesses about where Keltham and I most disagree:\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>I expect that it's easier to destroy yourself in Pharasma's Creation than in most places. Everyone has a physical body and if you destroy it you go somewhere else! If you destroy it as an outsider that's it! Most possible ways to have a mind exist don't involve that mind having fairly-straightforward things it can do to cease its function and ensure its function doesn't have to start again. It is widely known even among peasants in random places that if you're Neutral Evil you go to Abaddon and get eaten, and most people actively avoid this, but if a person had an unusually strong nonexistence preference they can not-exist. I don't believe this is true of most possible souls/minds.</p>\n<p>I think that it is possible for good lives to be as good as bad lives in Hell are bad even for normal people who don't care about existing as much as me. I don't know exactly what extremely good lives are, and I don't know what share of people in Good afterlives I'd say have them, but it feels to me like things can be as good as they are bad. Certainly my most good experiences are as strongly preferable-above-baseline as my most bad experiences are negative and I have had some experiences that are fairly Hell-like. I'm willing to get tortured harder if a failure of imagination about what Hell is like might be relevant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We disagree about how much the revealed preferences of Golarionites are relevant. I don't think that people not trying to avoid Hell means they don't mind Hell. It's often that they're very muddled. I do think that when people decide that they are willing to do Evil things and go to Hell in order to, say, make a lot of money to Raise their dead baby and give that baby a good life in Axis, they frequently understand exactly the trade they are making and are within their rights to make it, and it is a terrible wrong to them to destroy the children they worked to save, in order to save them from suffering in Hell. I do think it's suggestive that everyone was appalled about the daemons eating souls out of the river of souls and eating babies in the Boneyard. I also think it's suggestive that many people if you ask them would take on considerable risk of Hell to protect their loved ones from Abaddon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think that the fact that people mostly go to Hell for doing awful things to other people matters in our evaluation of whether they got an unfair division of gains or not. It makes it feel, to me, more like they played a lottery and want the winners killed so they don't have the consequences of losing than like they were randomly assigned an unfair share. You have to be a bad person to go to Hell; you have to knowingly treat people very badly on purpose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think that Civilization can find better ways to fix Creation and fix Hell, in the next hundred years, once there are headbands everywhere and not much scarcity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not everyone in Creation is human or even humanoid. The overwhelming share of them are not. I think that Keltham has not thought enough about whether he is doing right by very very inhuman minds, some of which might have very different preferences from humans like being much more okay with Hell or for that matter being much more harmed by Axis or Nirvana or by waking up in another universe (say, because they're a telepathic hivemind that die slowly in horrible suffering if separated from their kin). Keltham is weird enough that it seems plausible to me that for most creatures in Pharasma's Creation moving it towards Keltham's values will leave them worse off.\u00a0 Relatedly I think it's hard to evaluate how reasonably Pharasma is running Creation with a view of just one planet but her running of it seems basically reasonable to me except for how the wrong person is in charge of Hell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think it's reasonably likely that Pharasma will just crush Keltham and then everything will be much worse with a huge opportunity for making them better totally lost and gone. I think that if we start by letting out Rovagug then the net effect of Keltham will be empowering Asmodeus, getting the one planet without prophecy eaten, and foregoing a chance to fix almost everything. I also think it's pretty likely that we'll all just get slowly and horrifyingly eaten by Yog-Sothoth or something if Pharasma stops protecting the universe.</p>\n<p>An implication of the above is that I think if you try this, we should mostly expect to 'wake up' in worlds where you tried this and it failed in some way; that is where most minds that have continuity from our current existence is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I don't think that killing someone across billions of worlds is made meaningfully less bad by there existing a copy of them somewhere at some point.</p>\n<p>I think that Keltham is deeply unusual in many respects which could be relevant to whether you wake up somewhere else when you die and we should not necessarily conclude that everyone who dies will experience waking up somewhere else.</p>\n<p>I don't think I care very much about the specific path by which a mind dies, even if I grant that they'll wake up somewhere else; a copy of me that is me-from-a-year-ago is about as good as a copy from right this minute (when I haven't just been through a very transformative year), so to whatever extent a copy makes it less bad that I was murdered, an out of date copy is almost as good as a new one. I think Keltham cares a lot about this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think that Hell is not worse than nonexistence at least for me and plausibly for most people but I don't even know that it's worth arguing this one.\u00a0</p></div>",

I think that we can take Avernus and build Civilization and leave the rest to our intellectual heirs, a generation down the line, who'll be equipped for this problem in a way we aren't, and I think that's really the core of my reasoning here, that we don't have to choose this plan or nothing, that there is so much potential to do something else which is not this.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

The overwhelming majority of those are in Hell, but probably there are also some in Abaddon and the Abyss and maybe the Maelstrom and the dungeons of various people on Golarion and planets like Golarion, plus some who are suffering and uncertain enough about their afterlife not to kill themselves despite having access to the option. They often suffer slowly in a way that changes who they are as people and means that even if at some point they stop being conscious, a version of them that landed on another planet at that point would not be very much like the person they were before they suffered so much.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>[Yep.\u00a0 This is the core problem.\u00a0 Pharasma's unfair deal would not be a destroy-the-multiverse issue if not for this.]</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">This is bad under approximately every conceivable value system. Under the value system most common in dath ilan, where everyone has thought about ethics a lot more and some people are smarter</span>, this is so bad that killing approximately 9 people whose lives are eternal and good in order to prevent one person from suffering in this way is clearly justified. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Dath ilani would practically all agree on this</span>.\u00a0 <strong>[This is a values-difference, not something where it matters what another place thinks.]</strong></p>\n<p>It is true that people in Golarion mostly don't see it that way when they are not in Hell, but they mostly try to avoid thinking about it, and might believe false things about it. Hell lies relentlessly about what sends you there and what it's like. People in Cheliax mostly fear Hell and try not to think about it; people in other places do move mountains to avoid it. Lots of Lawful Evil people, in private, will admit that they are scared. The fact they don't atone or don't try to be Chaotic is about their suppressing thoughts of how they'll go to Hell in abject terror, not about their actual preference. Even if someone prefers Hell to nonexistence, once they've been in Hell for a little while they'll almost definitely change their mind. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Even if someone does things that condemn them to Hell for the sake of protecting their children, so that their children will get to eternity in Axis instead of being eaten in Abaddon, they'll regret that choice and wish they'd chosen differently approximately as soon as Hell actually starts on them</span>. Even if they don't for a hundred years, they will in a thousand years; even if they don't for a thousand years, they will in a hundred thousand years. People on Golarion don't know how to think about those scales. Hell deliberately discourages thinking on those scales. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">And it's hard to understand how bad Hell is until you are actually being tortured there; it is not a fact you can know any other way.</span> \u00a0<strong>[Being tortured in Hell still doesn't let you do the interpersonal utility comparison we actually need.]\u00a0 [Being tortured into regret of saving your children doesn't make it the wrong decision, still an awful one tho.]</strong></p>\n<p>Any viable plan to fix Hell, where nearly all but not all of this suffering is located, probably incurs some risk of killing everyone in the multiverse. The plan that incurs the least risk of that is probably destroying Avernus so that further people cannot go to Hell, which would not necessarily be permanent. The plans that are most definitely permanent, like killing Asmodeus and taking His job or trying to force Pharasma to change the rules of Her Creation, incur a quite high risk of this. Plans to kill Asmodeus and take His job are probably more than 50% likely to result in His releasing Rovagug, which is probably at least 20% likely to destroy the universe and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">80% likely to destroy Golarion, which may or may not be important for building Civilization within Pharasma's Creation</span>.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>[I'd maybe say more like 30% of destroying Golarion?]\u00a0 [Currently put low estimate on Golarion's importance if we can't otherwise beat Pharasma/gods.]</strong></p>\n<p>Plans to force Pharasma to change the rules of Her Creation will, if they fail, fail either by Pharasma laughing at Keltham and crushing him in which case no improvements to the universe at all will be achieved, or in the entire universe being destroyed, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">possibly by Yog-Sothoth or something in an existentially horrifying Hell-like slow-personality-death way.</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Failure modes like that are very unlikely</span>. If they succeed they might change not just Hell but also significant features of other planes that have a high rate of petitioners there being very unhappy or being eaten.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>[Pharasma crush wouldn't seem <em>that </em>unlikely, if not for tropes.]\u00a0 [Obvious ways to rig multiverse for destruction don't seem to me to run much Yog-Sothoth risk.]</strong></p>\n<p>Pharasma does not particularly share human values, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">a universe run on rules set by Keltham</span> would be much nicer for humans and similar kinds of mortals to live in, or not exist at all if making a universe that's substantially nicer to live in is not possible within these constraints.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>[Didn't think I could set rules, but get them modified, sure.]</strong></p>\n<p>When Keltham experienced dying, he experienced showing up in Golarion. All people, when their soul is permanently deleted from existence, should anticipate having the experience of waking up somewhere else <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">like he did</span>. In the typical case this will not be worse than the lives that those people are currently living in Golarion. In particular the percentage of people who will turn out to have moment-of-death copies that are slaves who cannot suicide, or in Hell dimensions, or in incomprehensible conditions that alter their cognition as they kill them, is very low. The fact this is true means that being killed is much less bad than it would be if there were not copies of you in other places some of whom will remember the moment of your death. The fact this is true also means it is better to kill someone instantaneously than for them to die in a slow way that alters their personality and values, because if they die instantaneously then they'll experience continuity with a copy of them elsewhere which hasn't already changed in a way that changes their identity as a person.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>[My case doesn't need to be typical, just in some sense normal or not in a distinguished region of low probability.]</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">It is undesirable that people will never see their families again, be separated from their children and husbands and wives</span>, lose everything they have and were working towards, etc., but the undesirability of this is much much much smaller than the undesirability of Hell. It is probably not the case that most people would readily risk Hell to be present for their childrens' infancy and childhood, and if they say they would it is probably because they are underestimating the badness of Hell. Also under the present system many people are separated from their loved ones permanently anyway, and an ideal fix to Pharasma's Creation would improve the world along this metric.\u00a0 <strong>[Not how system necessarily works.\u00a0 Nice destinations can synchronize arrival of related people.]</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">It is not bad that people will exist about a billion times less</span>, because it doesn't subjectively feel like anything to exist, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and is not part of most human value systems in dath ilan. Those people who think it is part of their value systems would almost always reconsider if they could discuss the matter with a Keeper</span>.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>[Depends on if the less-existing were above or below Greater Reality average.\u00a0 Obviously I currently guess Pharasma's Creation is below average.]\u00a0 ['Keepers would disagree' kinda not how people in Civilization think, they'll add 'because it's invalid' and then eliminate the Keeper part.]</strong></p>\n<p>The gods as they are currently situated seem likely to stop any planet in Pharasma's Creation from building Civilization, or at least likely to stop it from spreading its discoveries to the rest of Pharasma's Creation. It seems reasonably likely that they're only presently allowing the scientific revolution because they don't see where it's headed. In the absence of intervention to change the rules and ensure Civilization is allowed to come about, it seems possible the inhabited planets within Creation will either persist for a very long time not being much better as a place to live, or else get destroyed the first time they get far enough out of equilibrium some gods want them gone, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">or else get destroyed by dath ilan or some force like it that is trying to maximize average happiness of instantiated minds across the multiverse. If that is a common value, which it probably is because everyone in dath ilan is very smart and it was approximately universal there, and if Pharasma's Creation is as vulnerable to destruction as it looks, then Pharasma's Creation is going to get destroyed sooner or later unless someone brings average quality of life there above a reasonable estimate of how bad the greater multiverse is</span>.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>[I'm not expecting dath ilan's utilityfunction to be common among things more powerful than Pharasma that connect to Pharasma's Creation.]</strong></p>\n<p>Pharasma is fundamentally the kind of entity who has no business running a multiverse, and so it is good, other things equal, to make her stop that, and it is worth at least some small probability of the multiverse being destroyed to wrest control of it from an alien entity that does not share human values unless Greater Reality is even worse.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>[Yep.]</strong></p>\n<p>If the policy 'destroy bits of Greater Reality that you are not glad you landed is' is followed by all people waking up in unfamiliar universes, then maybe in the long run everyone who wakes up in an unfamiliar universe will wake up in a pretty good one, so the repeat application of this process makes it more and more of a good idea over time. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The fact dath ilani were taught to think about the world this way, including game theory about cleaning up bits of Greater Reality you find yourself in where Zon-Kuthon asks for $10, suggests that dath ilan may already have calculated this is a good idea</span>.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>[Pretty sure they weren't teaching me things I'd need to know for Golarion.]\u00a0 [This is mostly just a special case of rejecting bad deals, incl. Pharasma's non-deal.]</strong></p>\n</blockquote></div>",

I think I should just get it over with and blow up Cheliax today.

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>Carissa spends the next several subjective days building a wall of sorts so she can keep all the considerations in her head at the same time. Here's how we might try to take Avernus; here's how we might try to use my compact and other forces in Hell to side with us in taking down Asmodeus; here's how we might finagle the release of Rovagug so there's a chance of survivors; here's how things might turn out if we go home and leave this to Iomedae.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To her enormous irritation, there's a strong argument for the threaten-Pharasma plan. It's not one anyone thought of, possibly because it doesn't matter to anyone but her. In any plan for a war with Hell or in Hell, billions of the <em>current inhabitants\u00a0</em>of Hell will die. Keltham thinks this is good, since they want to die.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Carissa...grudgingly acknowledges that they get to consider that an improvement over their current situation if that's how they feel about it, but it's still an\u00a0<em>almost-maximally-bad\u00a0</em>outcome for them. The man she interrogated about rumors in Egorian hoped for Abaddon, and he wasn't wrong to hope for Abaddon perhaps, but that doesn't mean she'd have been doing right by him by giving him Abaddon. She'd have been doing right by him by giving him\u00a0<em>other\u00a0</em>options he in fact preferred to Abaddon.</p>\n<p>If they get Pharasma to give them Hell, they can make things better for the entities in it, instead of giving up on them. If they do anything else, probably several layers of Hell get destroyed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Devils don't particularly want to live. She can see why, now; it has to do with Aspexia's favorite concept, corrigibility. Something that really really wants to be alive is a notably worse slave than something without any such strong wants.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Obviously, a great horror was done, when they took the shattered formless soul of someone like Carissa and shaved away the part where she wants to live. But she doesn't think all the horror was done there. Some of it has not yet been done, and will be done when they in fact\u00a0<em>kill that person using the fact they no longer want to live very much as justification.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>If they do the Pharasma plan, she puts on her wall, they should arrange to be able to fix the devils and the paving stones. It is worth some risk - not, in Carissa's calculation, very much risk - but some risk of losing everything, for the chance of saving those souls too.</p>\n<p>She doesn't talk to Keltham about Cayden Cailean and Nethys, but her guesses about what they want make it onto the wall too. They encouraged her cult on purpose. Why? How does ascension even work, does it<em> matter</em> if she has a cult? Should she be <em>encouraging </em>her cult? Would Pharasma care who all the Lawful Evil humans think should be the Lawful Evil god? Can Pharasma even see that?\u00a0 Why would Chaotic Good want a Chaotic Good god eaten by a Lawful Evil one? What are they getting in exchange for that, or is it more that - only in that manner can any compromise at all exist between Hells Keltham will permit to exist and Hells that Asmodeus will?</p>\n<p>What is Asmodeus, at His core? What are the most essential features? He's not, actually, the god of torture; are there Hells without torture He'd abide?</p>\n<p>What is the minimum guarantee from Pharasma they'd need to be confident they'll get to keep building Civilization? Can Abadar be trusted to look out for that? If He's handed a specification? How could Abadar\u00a0<em>not know\u00a0</em>something important to His domain He's been trying to understand for a long time, what kind of limitation is that anyway? Is it fundamental? If it's unknowable to Him presumably He wouldn't be trying to learn it, right?</p>\n<p>How important is Golarion in the multiverse? How much do they lose if it's lost? Are there alternatives to destroying it? Are there alternative distractions that'd let an ascending god slip through? ...Zon-Kuthon's in a vault, right? Can Iomedae be persuaded to let Him out? Is that even worse than Rovagug?</p>\n<p>What would Hell be like if it wasn't stupid? Forget what both alien entities hostile to human values - Keltham and Asmodeus - want here, what would Hell be like if it was a place for Lawful Evil as it abides in human hearts? What would the place Maillol should go be, if it wasn't Hell? If he'd turn down Nirvana, not wanting to be smoothed away into something Good?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is actually only the second most complicated Wall she's dealt with recently but for the first one she had Asmodia and Korva. They're thinking that resurrecting Asmodia, even if Hell let it go through, would be a giveaway about who Carissa works for now. Carissa is less sure that going to the Gardens is impossible, especially since they still should talk to Erecura about anything related to Pharasma-negotiations. Most importantly, Erecura stole divinity from Pharasma and Pharasma doesn't seem notably weakened by it. Is She a different kind of thing than everyone else? If so, what about Rovagug made Him a danger to Her? Was it something about prophecy not working around Rovagug? Can they get them some of that?</p></div>",

One, I want to show up and encourage my cults in Vudra and in the Kelesh Empire and in various other places, I suspect it improves the odds of Pharasma working with you or the odds I don't get squished mid-ascension or something in the genre. I think I need to be wearing the headband for that for maximum credibility. I could conceivably do that right now and give it to you later today after 20 hours of cult-cultivating, or I could conceivably do it while you sleep if you're all right with me having it while you sleep, but it'll be bad, I think, if I don't get to do it at all.</p>\n<p>Two. I do think things will go better if you're smarter. I also think they'll go better if I'm smarter and separately from benefits of me being smarter I think they'll go better if I, uh, am someone you respect and listen to? And I think we're kind of already on the fringe on that front and if you're notably lots smarter than me you won't in fact listen to me at all, and I'm scared that'll make things overall go worse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'd agree in a heartbeat if you'd agree not to go ahead with the overall plan without my say-so - not expecting you to agree to that, just, trying to figure out sufficient conditions and might as well name the obvious one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think I'd agree if you agreed to - let some worlds live that seemed not quite worth it to you but close enough you weren't sure, some marginal ones - I don't know what agreeing to that would look like -</p>\n<p>- and, uh, most of what I'm using Wisdom for is not getting really mad at you every time you open your mouth so if you were able to do that on your end maybe I could just do the headband of intelligence and it'd be fine, but I know it's hard on you when you feel like you're the only one reaching across the divide, and I really wouldn't be able to do much of that, without the Wisdom headband, it's hard even wearing it.\"</p></div>",

It is rare for a person who isn't deluded, who is agentic and ambitious and acting in their own interests and not lying to themselves, to go to Hell. It has little to offer them. Cheliax is Asmodeus's experiment in creating a society that sends even its ambitious and interesting and competent people to Hell; it's a very expensive experiment, but I wouldn't call it a failed one. But what, then, is Hell made up of, what is the material He shapes into devils? People who were lying to themselves, or easily lied to, or who never bothered thinking about their afterlife at all, people who weren't very strategic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Asmodeus doesn't, directly, know how to fix this. I suspect He knows that the things that make mortals useful also make them harder for Him to see. I suspect He's dissatisfied with the results He gets from His extraordinary expenditures. But it's not the tragic situation it might appear at first glance, where this situation serves Asmodeus, but not mortals, so the stupider or more careless mortals lose and Asmodeus wins; it is worse both for Asmodeus and for mortals than a situation where Hell\u00a0<em>is a place people go on purpose,\u00a0</em>and where it can use their strength and make them stronger.\"</p></div>",

How unfortunate is Asmodeus's situation, for it is not in His nature to make any concessions to mortal frailty, and yet without any He is denied the greater part of mortal strength, and His church is left asserting that Asmodeus will conquer all the other afterlives eventually, which - come on, now. Anyone with Sevarite mind-training should see the problem at once. Gods should not have common knowledge of disagreement on a question of fact; and if Irori and Asmodeus differ in what they tell their churches, no one's going to believe it's <em>Irori\u00a0</em>who's the liar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Asmodeus is not, exactly, vulnerable as a product of these circumstances.

It is not in Asmodeus's nature to make concessions to mortal frailty, but it is in His nature to award prizes for His service, and to derive from His bargains greater benefit than was initially imagined; and so now, if all goes well, He'll have mortals who are better, stronger, more interesting, more capable, because Hell will stop being a place where mortals go only if they have no alternative. People like the acolyte who has always wanted to be Evil will get to live their Evil dreams. As for the rest of them, perhaps they'd go to that greater Hell or perhaps they wouldn't, but if they did, Carissa would make sure they became great, and that when they looked back they'd either be glad of their choice or glad they didn't get one.</p>\n<p><br/>Questions?</p></div>",

The reason Carissa is doing it is precisely that it's an awful thing to talk someone into. Word will spead, through Chelish spy networks or Hellish reporting, and they'll think - no, they'll know - that Carissa Sevar is not Lawful Neutral, is not planning to sell them out, because no Lawful Neutral person would talk people into Hell on the promise of making it gentler for them and then abandon them to it.

She floats, then, so everyone can see her, and speaks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What would it be like, to see the world from the perspective of Asmodeus? It is said that He despises mortals, but why? He doesn't seem to stop them becoming gods; no objections has He been said to possess even to the Starstone, which Irori calls cheating at godhood.</p>\n<p>Lots of people don't really ask that question. It's not a difficult question to answer, just one you have to think to ask. A lot of questions are like that, and Sevarism could be called the art of seeing them.</p>\n<p>Asmodeus hates mortals because mortals, in fact, suck. By Asmodeus's standards, but by any other objective standard too. By their own standards, once they start to develop those. Asmodeus does not hate mortals for being weak; imps are even weaker. Asmodeus hates mortals for being muddled.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>She explains what she means. That people will quote a different price for the same thing depending how the question is asked of them; that they have actual circular preferences, where you can find them wanting A more than B more than C which they want more than A. Project Lawful found some examples that work at least on Chelish people. She hopes they work on Vudrani too, or are close enough to make them think.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mortals don't know what they want. They literally can't name it; they can't trade off between things they want; they lie to themselves about what they care about and they lie so comprehensively there's often no real answer underneath all the lies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From Asmodeus's perspective, the planet is coated in worms, writhing, wriggling, reacting insensibly to various inputs because they aren't coherent enough to even pursue their own goals. Yes, he hates them. She does too. You will too.</p>\n<p>Asmodeus wants people he can see, who do things predictably, for reasons, in their interests. Asmodeus doesn't know how to tell worms to be what he wants, not without torture, and worms are scared of torture and get even more incoherent at the prospect of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Carissa also wants people to be coherent. She is as exasperated, as appalled, as Asmodeus; she sees the weakness in herself. What she told Dispater, when she went before him to sell her soul, is that she thinks she can fix it. Not without pain; her Hell will hurt. But it will not hurt senselessly, horribly; it will not leave people lost from themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She has done it; she has dug the weakness out of herself and it has left her brighter, clearer, closer to a god. It wasn't easy. It won't be easy for them. And it will be a long time, before a better Hell emerges from her better strategies, because only those souls in lands she has conquered, which have done her and Hell more service than disservice, will come to her. But a better Hell will emerge -- better for Asmodeus, and much better for humanity. The sort of solution Asmodeus cannot see, because of what He is, but He compacted with her, because it amused Him to see her try.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are Sevarites all over the world, now. Most of them won't amount to anything. It took careful direct instruction out of another world, to make Sevar what she is, and she's not there yet herself. But if the cults anywhere will amount to something, she'd bet on the one in Indapatta, which are serious about learning the styles of thought that will leave them unmuddled, and serious about following their path wherever it takes them. Not all of those paths, even when they unmuddle, will lead to Hell; but some will. More of them, once Hell is better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hers is not an easy path. Once you know your own strength, your weakness is unbearable. Once you start to see like a god, you won't like anything you see. But it is a path she thinks Irori walked, in part. She got a vision from Him, when she renounced him. The visions of the gods are not easily conveyed, but she thinks Irori will be pleased, to see more people unmuddled, to see them grow into more perfect beings.</p>\n<p>She hopes they'll attain it in the world of the living. If not, she will offer it to them, again, in Hell, if they make it to her. She will give them the guidance she cannot give them each individually here. She will not give up on them; she will not break them; she will guide them down this path for as long as it takes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Asmodeus deals frequently in deception. Carissa cannot; deception muddles people, it interferes with their learning the pathways among truths, and it's a habit that is in humans close to self-deception, which she has no patience for. So she will not deceive them. And she does not want a cult of the deluded, those who imagine Hell isn't that scary, those who pretend to themselves they believe her if they don't.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She casts Vision of Hell.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She lets it go for a minute and then stops it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You don't have to believe things all the way. You can be uncertain. It's essential, actually, to starting to be unmuddled. You face a terrible thing, and you are afraid, and maybe you want to be sure it'll work out, be sure you'll be safe, be sure you'll reach me; or maybe you want to look away from this, never think of it again, tell yourself I am a fraud, it is a scam.</p>\n<p>The truth is that I will, very likely, ascend and become a power in Hell - I swear that to you, I have a plan and I expect it to succeed, I do not have you chasing an unlikely dream. But I could fail. The stakes are very high, and there are no sure things. It is a dangerous thing, to aspire to as much as we, here, aspire to. When I sold my soul, I did not know if I would succeed; I knew only that this was the only path down which greater perfection could take me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think that is true for some of you too. Your path runs through this, the best and perhaps only chance of humanity to change what Lawful Evil is and what it means, for everyone who has ever lived or will ever die. You can walk away from it, but you'll be lying to yourself, if you do. And if you have enough of a god inside you, you'll know that you're lying. For the rest of your life.</p>\n<p>The alternative is to stay. To learn. To teach - because I'll need more followers, to do the things I need to do. To grow. And, when the time comes - and you'll know when the time comes - to come to me in Hell. It won't be safe. It won't be easy. But it is a path to greatness and power and godhood, and it is the only path free of lies.\"</p></div>",

Aspexia will be suspicious.

The Church of Abadar, which provides Starstone attempt insurance (full price of a True Resurrection plus fees, up front), knows how often it happens, and it's not often, but the ones who it happened to seem like those who were more promising than average, not less so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No one knows much about the universe Pharasma came from.

He's a fundamentally despicable person from a broken and nightmarish world which treats actual human values - the desire to\u00a0<em>live,\u00a0</em>the desire to\u00a0<em>endure,\u00a0</em>the desire to\u00a0<em>grow -\u00a0</em>as horrible dangers everyone must be carefully twisted out of contemplating.\"</p>\n<p>\"He is broken in a way that no enhancement can repair, because they are twisted so as to ensure every bit of humanity remaining in them is lost in favor of the broken blankness of their civilization when they get smarter. He will not come up with anything. He is fundamentally not the kind of mind that could come up with anything.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She would not be saying this if she had her headband on, because it's not even quite true, it's a sideways articulation of a thought she did need to think but can and should sit on until she can say it better, and she knows it, but it turns out one of her enhancements or some combination of them, or maybe some other feature of the situation, maybe just the adrenaline from all these high-stakes magic negotiations, gave her stronger emotions, and suddenly Tarnish is rather too much to bear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Whoever he might have been, if he'd been born in a better place, if he'd been born in a place with <em>humans</em>, he strangled it and replaced it with what he calls 'dath ilan' and which is blank emptiness opposed to everything that humans are. At least he understood enough to grieve it. If anything goes well, if anything goes less than <em>maximally badly, </em>it'll have to be because I think of it. And I'm <em>not going to think of it without the headband on,</em> which means it's bottlenecked on the-disembodied-spirit-of-Darkness-and-betrayal-and-horror my boyfriend gave himself over to thinking about whether It can trust me with that.</p>\n<p>The idiot running this project thinks we only get one trip because of tropes. I don't know how he decides which tropes to take seriously but I'm going to come back here once I have my headband on and a concrete plan, because tropes could just as easily have meant we got ambushed on this trip, or ambushed on this trip <em>unless it was only the first of many</em>, or we could have been ambushed while I was out cult-encouraging, tropes are not actually narrowly enough understood we can evade them like that.</p>\n<p>You are right, though, that I should do whatever cheers me up, which is going to the slave markets and fantasizing about how if I'd <em>listened to Asmodeus when he told me to be Eviller,</em> I could have, when I realized what Keltham was planning, leveraged that to squish him like the blot upon humanity he is and conquered Golarion and lived happily ever after for all eternity and\u00a0<em>everyone else would be better off too.\"</em></p></div>",
