Paladins can't experience fear, but they can experience eternal torture, and Cheliax delights in sending them on to it; there are places where more good can be done at a lower cost. But in the end, Cheliax is going to need to be overthrown, and you have to be in Cheliax to see the fractures when they start and can be encouraged in spreading. Plus, sometimes something really unexpected happens and you need to have people who can act quickly.\u00a0<br/><br/>Andreu Bassols (not his birth name) has been living in Egorian for two years, having moved from a small farming village when his parents died and it didn't seem worth keeping up the farm alone. He loads and unloads river barges; he's a strong man, built for hard labor. He has, beneath the skin on his neck and separately beneath the skin on his thigh, two minor magic items, which conceal an aura that would otherwise radiate from him and betray him. Either would be sufficient, but it's a new experimental type of magic item, and either could fail, so it's better to have both.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>He reads as having seven intelligence; his thoughts, when read, are slow, and uninteresting. This is the greatest sacrifice, aside from the possible eternity of damnation; the effect could not be manufactured. It had to be induced for real. He can lift it, when he puts his healing to that purpose, but it's risky, so he does it rarely.\u00a0<br/><br/>He did it this morning; knelt in the cellar he sleeps in, the walls and ceiling too thick for Detect Thoughts, and healed himself, and read an encoded report delivered on a river barge, and broke down the plan into steps he would still, later, understand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's afternoon, now, and he is pushing a wheelbarrow of potatoes into the kitchens of the palace in Egorian.\u00a0</p></div>",

It seemed like the best possible grounds on which to ignore his stated wish that no one interrupt him while he was thinking, and I was <em>very</em> worried about what would happen if he went on thinking.

Iomedae observes that\u00a0information beneficial to the interests of Cayden Cailean is probably information She would <em>pay</em> for, unless something is very strange.\u00a0 Such as Nethys having figured out how to feed parts of him information that make them convinced of things the whole of Him does not believe, and how to let those parts make themselves legible to other gods, persuasively so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It could be something that sits in their very real values difference; something that Cayden Cailean is barely in favor of but which involves the total destruction of Iomedae and all Her followers and which therefore She is barely against.

Maybe, Cayden could just stop that, and try not expending the resources of Good against fellow forces of Good, and get Himself together to think about what shape of commitment from Iomedae would enable that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

Instead of one project, with a time limit we don't know, we have two projects moving in parallel - the project in which Keltham comes to understand Golarion, and the project in which he comes to be corrupted by it. We've just got to make sure the corruption stays out in front - that he never learns anything\u00a0<em>too\u00a0</em>Evil for where he's at at that moment.

We lose if he ever learns something he isn\u2019t ready to accept. High Priestess Subirachs is here to try to make you valuable enough that Keltham will change his own rules to have you; I\u2019m here to try to keep you from saying things that separate Cheliax from Taldor.</p>\n<p>A question you might be considering: what, then, is the role of our lessons? The answer is that only an Evil dath ilani is competent to lie to a Good dath ilani, and so we will have to become them, and that Keltham isn\u2019t going to want girls who can\u2019t keep up with him, so the girls valuable to the project are the ones who can. All of us would have been taken off this project by now, if learning how to think wasn\u2019t totally essential to it, or if it was possible to learn how to think like a dath ilani with anything less than a full time effort. A dath ilani is very nearly priceless to Cheliax. You have the chance to become one. You should be utterly ruthless about arranging to succeed at your lessons; if you think of something that might help, request it. If you think of something that\u2019s getting in the way, we will check if we can be rid of it.</p>\n<p>The punishment order I laid out earlier is obviously heretical. It probably won\u2019t work. It has been authorized anyway because it is that important for all of you to master this art: a thousand important things might be set aside, if that makes you faster at learning to think.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to do the draw now, for who gets punished normally, so the effects of punishment don\u2019t get mixed up with the effects of believing your superiors are out to get you, or anything like that. Mind, even if you\u2019re selected, you aren\u2019t being unduly punished, you just aren\u2019t being experimentally neglected. Here are slips of paper with all your names.\"<br/><br/>She demonstrates them, mixes them.</p></div>",

And I thought to myself, you know, I can't actually think of a principled reason you can't bridge that with a scaffold and use spellsilver that far away, except for how it'd be ridiculously hard and might mess up the spellsilver and there's usually literally no reason. So I did, and started transforming my armillary amulet -\" she taps it \"- into a weapon I could use to break out, except it would've taken way too long, the weapon I wanted is a three day enchanting project, but I thought of some ways to do it faster, and Abrogail let me at this for a while because it was funny and then went back to what she'd been meaning to do with me. And I don't specifically know that I levelled\u00a0<em>from that\u00a0</em>but it was representative.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She's not keeping her voice down. It's a good story.</p></div>",

We think Pilar went to Elysium as a consequence of it, somehow.

It worked out fine, but it might not have. It's possible your curse is trying to get you in the habit of doing curse things without checking if they are also the best deal you can get Cheliax and our Lord. It is stupid, dangerous, and stupidly dangerous to operate in the palace without understanding the Queen and what she'll want to hear about and what to involve her in directly, but I am tempering my judgment over that because I'm not sure that the important people in the room would've known what to tell you.</p>\n<p>It is very Asmodean to be able to make yourself believe useful things that you know on some level Nemamel, with your information, wouldn't believe. I don't - get why, actually, and I think it might be close to the secret of Evil dath ilan, and this might veer close towards instruction on faith, which I can't offer you, but I'm not going to punish believing that the paladins should get to go home because that'd be nice for them; your beliefs ought to serve Asmodeus, and that one did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the whole I don't hear major errors, in that. You are in the power of a really annoying enemy, which permits you very little of what it'd be healthy for you to enjoy; but getting rid of all Lastwall's spies is a huge achievement, and might let us root out their revolutionaries, too, if they have worse information.

She really thinks that her life would be easier to handle without them. She's aware that this is ridiculous, and ungrateful, and in a sense as objectively wrong as a thought can possibly be. But having feelings? Really inconvenient! Kind of the worst! It doesn't make her feel more whole and more able to handle the task ahead, it makes her feel overfull. Bloated. Lost. Stupid. Pathetic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It feels - maybe wrongly - like this whole deception is hanging on Carissa alone. Keltham's dark fantasy is that this is one of a thousand projects, half-neglected, just-in-case, but it's the real thing, the only thing they've got. She is not a participant in a system whose victory is inevitable. If they succeed it'll be because of her and if they fail it'll be because of her.</p>\n<p>(Asmodeus's larger victory is inevitable, though, presumably.)</p>\n<p>(But how much of a victory would that even be, if it occurred without fixing how Cheliax trains people and how Hell trains devils, if it held the state of the art still in its current place rather than leveraging it to make everything better..... heretical, almost definitely heretical.)</p>\n<p>She is at the point where she'd generally start wishing she was on fire but she's not actually quite wishing that. She doesn't feel quite ready.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A bunch of thoughts are floating around in her head half-formed, and she needs to get better at thinking them, at not ignoring them, but in Keltham's arms it's like it's hard to access the Carissa who demanded three Wishes of a devil. She halfheartedly tries to pin them all down for contemplation later, but even that feels like swimming uphill. Are tropes real? They seem to be making good predictions about Carissa not selling her soul and having some bizarre reason not to tell Keltham. Put a pin in that. Does she know anything that can justify her value to Dis? Not yet, but in a couple months, maybe. Put a pin in that. Is Hell good at what it does? Put a pin in that. What is Cayden Cailean doing. Put a pin in that. Is there a way to prove to Keltham that masochists exist and aren't all faking. Put a pin in that. Is Meritxell a good next partner for Keltham. Pin. Are they succeeding at making Keltham Asmodean or just technically-Evil, and does the latter serve them at all? Pin. The aim of all this is to make Keltham and Cheliax enough alike that when they truly meet, Keltham isn't repelled. Is the way to achieve that changing Keltham or changing Cheliax? Pin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's too much; one of those questions might well be the key to the whole thing, but she doesn't know which one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After Keltham has fallen asleep she finds herself lying awake, terrified, arguing in her head with not-real-Keltham whose deepest underlying terror is apparently that she doesn't want to be there with him. It's not a problem she's ever had before. She's not the kind of person who lies awake imagining burning in Hell; probably burning in Hell won't be very fun, but what in the world would she gain by imagining it?\u00a0</p></div>",

Carissa Sevar has learned from the anomaly something of what it means to be a god, which is not simply about touching a Starstone or gaining power over the world or encyclopedic knowledge or some vague concept of 'perfection'.</p>\n<p>Irori then bargained with Asmodeus that Carissa Sevar's soul not be bought by Him, and that she not be prevented in leaving Cheliax if her footsteps took her beyond it in time.\u00a0 Asmodeus may have taken this as a challenge and decided to interpret it as a contest for Carissa Sevar's soul, which, if so, Irori had thought would probably be good for her pathway to epicness and godhood and hopefully beyond.</p>\n<p>By some strange course of events this led to Carissa Sevar's eternity standing in peril, at the hands of some powerful creature of Cheliax apparently meaning to transform her into a statue, ward her petrified form, bury her never to be found.\u00a0 And so Irori marked her, softly enough that neither she nor her tormentor would notice it, so that someday some caster willing to be quested by Him could retrieve her.</p>\n<p>A few hours later Irori got an incredibly irate call from Otolmens asking why one of the mortals in Her interdicted zone standing quite close to the anomaly seemed to now be an unfinished cleric of Irori's.\u00a0 Irori went very completely legible about how much He had absolutely not been planning to causally impact the interdicted zone in any way.\u00a0 Otolmens is still upset about this and, frankly, Irori can't blame Her.\u00a0 Otolmens has gone to nearly the greatest possible lengths available to Her to reduce the amount of divine interference around the anomaly, and the clerics and oracles around him are still accumulating.</p>\n<p>Irori still has no idea what the heck happened with Carissa Sevar apparently being set to be petrified and buried by some being of great power and Evil, and then her apparently being fine a few hours later.\u00a0 Even if it had somehow been a false threat, Carissa Sevar's soul does not appear scarred in the way that mortals would usually be scarred by such extreme threat and fear; it was as if the whole event had happened to someone else who was also Carissa Sevar, and so also marked by Him as His cleric.\u00a0 Memory erasure of the episode?\u00a0 Maybe she has two personalities and only one of them is scarred now, and she's currently using the other one, and that one doesn't remember?\u00a0 Irori does not have compelling theories here; nothing He has seen previously happen to observed mortals matches this.\u00a0 It is like the end of one time's thread was sliced out and spliced with the start of another; one where her soul's health is if anything improved.</p>\n<p>He does not know why Abadar's cleric would pay thus for an option on Carissa Sevar's soul, except for the obvious fear that it stands somehow in danger of being bought, despite Irori having bargained with Asmodeus for that not to happen.\u00a0 There are standard clauses in the compact for which Irori paid Asmodeus whereby Irori Himself could revoke it, but this He cannot be threatened into doing, nor would He do it even at Carissa Sevar's own request if she were being forced into making it.\u00a0 Irori would of course revoke it if Carissa Sevar prayed to Him and seemed in full sincerity to believe that her Way made that her next step forward, but then in a case like that there is also no reason why Abadar's cleric would need to protect her.\u00a0 Irori's best guess is that Carissa Sevar falsely believes that there is a prospect of her soul's sale being forced, and Abadar's cleric is seeking to protect her from that.\u00a0 Even the Asmodeans may not yet know her soul is unbuyable.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>With all that said, Irori does not exactly have a merchant group of which Carissa Sevar is an employee, that is monitoring Carissa Sevar and has notes to compare on her.\u00a0 Nor, in fact, is it particularly evident that Carissa Sevar would need or want any more of Irori's aid, considering how past attempts at that have been working out for Him and her.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>That also said, Irori is aware of Abadar's communications difficulties.\u00a0 Irori can perhaps send forth some mortal willing to receive a vision from Him, to speak to those mortals that Abadar trades with, and say what Irori knows and can make clear.\u00a0 But this Irori would not do of His own accord, nor does He much expect that His interests will benefit from the quested mortal hearing whatever they may hear in return.\u00a0 It would come out of Abadar's own intervention budget.</p>\n<p>(Which is, for those gods present in the beginning, who are not now too much in disaccord with the way that things are, more generous than any intervention budget ever granted by them to any god that was once human.)</p></div>",

It's a weak spell, normally, and doesn't last long, but cast by the most powerful mage in all the Inner Sea, Nefreti Clepati, at our very own Temple of the All-Seeing Eye, it lasts more than three hours - an hour left, on this batch, which you get a discount for - and the effect is much much more powerful. I know people who say they'd take it over a headband, if you could bottle it in a headband, which you can't.

If they're bad at guessing then they're going to set the bounty too high, or too low, and lose money, next to an insurance company run by people who know how to count. And they've been at it a while, so they're not bad at guessing, and no one would take a bounty from a place that didn't guess, or didn't tell you their guess.

He didn't exist, to the eyes of Golarion's gods, a week ago. Abadar, immediately on noticing him, paid Asmodeus not to engage in any of the misconduct to which Asmodeus and his followers tend, and the Asmodeans took Keltham to a secret facility for a secret project they are calling Project Lawful. For some reason the primary participants in it are Carissa Sevar, a former third-circle weapons enchanter at the Worldwound who may be the first person to have run across Keltham, and nine girls from the graduating class at Ostenso's academy of magic, who by now are rumored in Cheliax to have spectacular powers, and indeed seem to.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pause for questions.</p></div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>Note from Asmodia to Sevar, delivered by Security after Sevar leaves Subirachs's office:</p>\n<p><br/>Keltham tapped six girls with Owl's Wisdom and told them to go off to their bedrooms to think afterwards. \u00a0Asmodia was one of them. \u00a0This report was written in haste under the Owl's Wisdom but completed after it ended.</p>\n<p>Asmodia has now realized that when she responded to Keltham's inquiry about her superpowers by asking 'Why is everyone asking me that?' this was a potentially catastrophic error, if Keltham had not believed that the Crown was supposed to be aware of his speculation.\u00a0 Asmodia had not been briefed on that aspect one way or another, so the correct decision for Asmodia would have been to take the lesser risk of not mentioning that anyone else had asked her; even though this would have also been a risk because, if Keltham did expect others to know, real-Asmodia would have behaved differently from alter-Asmodia. \u00a0Asmodia notes in her defense that she had very little time to think when Keltham sprung that question on her, and that she erred on the side of not lying, even though concealment was the correct course given what she didn't know.</p>\n<p>Asmodia notes that she believes the fault for this narrowly averted event lies not only with herself, but also that nobody briefed her on Keltham's expectations about the Crown order to check her for superpowers, in particular, whether Keltham was supposed to know that this event had happened.</p>\n<p>Asmodia registers her suspicion that too much information is being hidden from people who aren't Keltham. \u00a0This isn't an ordinary project where people can know only what they need to know, it's a project built around an intricate fragile lie and everybody who isn't being lied-to needs to know what's going on with every part of the lie at every point.</p>\n<p>Asmodia notes that she would probably have tried to deny this whole chain of thought to herself if she wasn't on the new only-Taldorian-punishment regime, shutting it down well <em>before </em>it got to the point of Asmodia thinking about having done something worthy of punishment somewhere Security could hear those thoughts and censure her if she didn't report them. \u00a0Initially starting to look for and think about what you might have done wrong is dangerous, if you will need to report any new errors you find and get punished for those.\u00a0 Asmodia is also being more honest in reporting what she sees as potential flaws in what's going on around her, because she expects less to be punished for that risk if she questions her teacher and proves to be wrong.</p>\n<p>Asmodia registers Prediction: \u00a0Tonia will either fail wholly to master dath ilani thought, or will be tortured beyond the point of usefulness for heretical thoughts, or will have dath ilani thought successfully tortured out of her as something inside her realizes that she loses points each time she plays the game.</p>\n<p>Asmodia means no insubordination by any of this and will obviously accept instruction and correction if she is mistaken.</p>\n<p>Asmodia has also realized that she is acting very visibly different from her supposed alter-Cheliax self. \u00a0Alter-Asmodia is incredibly curious what the Abyss Keltham was talking about, which real-Asmodia also is, but alter-Asmodia does not have any reason not to be talking to Keltham about this already, because alter-Asmodia isn't scared quiet by Security or Sevar or concerns that something huge is going on that she is not supposed to know about. \u00a0Alter-Asmodia wants to know if Keltham has a way for her to <em>get </em>superpowers next time she's in Hell.\u00a0 Alter-Asmodia asked him about it at breakfast in front of all the other girls.\u00a0 Please advise.</p></div>",

So, at the Worldwound, the first thing you do with new recruits is seventy-hour weeks, of physical exercises and training and digging ditches and stuff, because the first thing you need to learn to serve in a military is how to <em>do the thing that's been assigned to you,\u00a0</em>alongside other people you can similarly rely on to do the thing assigned to them. It's not about Good or Evil; the paladins have basically the same thing. Maybe in dath ilan you teach everyone enough Law, explicitly, that they have that expectation of common doing-the-job without having gone through a really long hard time of doing-the-job, but we don't, so that's how we build it.</p>\n<p>And obviously in some situations you want your soldiers to exercise initiative and argue with their orders and point out problems they observe, but - 'that sounds hard' isn't generally a situation where you do? As long as you're sourcing your girls from ones who're cleared to take the Worldwound oath - and I think you probably should be sourcing from that, it's the only bar we've got for - for being at all ready to start on this path - then you're sourcing from people in training to spend the next decade of their lives in a brutal fight in the fucking tundra against an infinite horde of demons, and no, they're not going to complain that they've got more tasks assigned than hours in the day. ....I have no idea what Ione's life plans are but I have a weird suspicion that while she's cleared for the Worldwound she actually just wants to do Nethys things which involve no boot camp at all. ...that's what it's called, boot camp, I don't know how that'd translate.\"</p></div>",

It proposes measuring this a couple of different ways and using the middle measurement, and referring disputes to Hell for arbitration. It can be paid out in Cheliax's fiat currency, backed by Hell, or in gold if they have enough gold. It predicts that Cheliax would learn all these things a year later, if Keltham did this work elsewhere, and does not want Cheliax worse off for being the place where Keltham did it, so the fair division (in the contract's reckoning) decreases substantially over time.</p></div>",

because his #7 <em>is the key, it has to be</em>.</p>\n<p>It might not have been a decision she'd have made before for any Wisdom, but the added Splendour is helping, even that is helping, for some element of that is lending Asmodia a driving will and force that she had only known before in the grips of exultation.\u00a0 Keltham thinks this problem set is <em>possible</em> to at least one of his students, and maybe he would've been wrong about that; but if Keltham can <em>imagine </em>that being possible, then this Asmodia could should <em>will</em> get it done within a single hour.</p>\n<p>She hit his #1 and bounced, it is too poetic she does not know what it\u00a0<em>means</em> so back off and try #2 that's just too obvious it says that the thing-that-is-a-likelihood-ratio has to be extreme to overcome an extreme thing-that-is-the-prior-odds, is there something she's missing, just assume not for now and continue, she tries #3 it doesn't solve <em>immediately</em> there's no <em>obvious</em> thing it means, so try #4 and see if solving all the fast problems helps and #4 isn't instantly obvious but Asmodia can feel in her mind the hint of a shape where it might be pointing so she starts scribbling down numbers.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Cheliax has fewer proverbs about mathematics than does dath ilan; it lacks in particular a proverb to the effect that quite often in mathematics, and with only rare exceptions, knowing what you need to prove is nine-tenths of the real work.</p>\n<p>The lost people out of Civilization's lost beginnings who first invented these ideas took longer to get there, from the bones of probability theory.\u00a0 But they did not have informal statements of where they should be going; and also they were not quite as smart as Asmodia is now, along some dimensions of thinkoomph if not others.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>So it doesn't take Asmodia much scribbling at all to see that if Conspiracy and Ordinary make the same predictions at the same strength then neither world can win out over the other one, to see the <em>abstract point</em> that if P(evidence \u25c1 hypothesis 1) = P(evidence \u25c1 hypothesis 2) then their ratio is 1:1 and the posterior odds are the same as the prior odds, while if P(evidence \u25c1 hypothesis 2) is 0 or just very tiny then as soon as you see the evidence you are convinced of hypothesis 1 no rather you're convinced that hypothesis 2 is false there could be\u00a0<em>other hypotheses\u00a0</em>even if Keltham only hinted at that it's\u00a0<em>clear how to adapt the math</em> and she's\u00a0<em>doing</em> it, she has enough of this Law to\u00a0<em>invent the rest</em>, onward Asmodia goes to #5 and though she has no integral calculus with which to think in densities she imagines each of a thousand possible numbers between 0 and 10 down to a hundredth of fineness, and soon she has understood #5, or she thinks she's understood, no she <em>has</em> that's just the obvious thing it <em>means</em> mathematically, when you call it down to a hundredth part your prediction is ten times as strong there as if someone else called it down to a tenth,\u00a0she is <em>doing </em>it she is inventing completing seeing the Law of Probability parsing the world with Keltham's own Sight, and the feeling that goes through her is glory.</p></div>",

It's hard to see from a mortal angle, but gods are doing Asmodeus favors who would not have been expected to do Asmodeus favors. Cayden Cailean gifted Pilar with the ability to track down every spy for Iomedae in Egorian, as long as she threw a party for them before kicking them out of the country, instead of executing them. That's what she was doing in Egorian. Broom's god - this is secret from Keltham, but permitted to know in the project - <em>teleported every diamond anywhere in Nidal to Broom</em>, at the same time as Asmodeus sent Maillol a vision saying we should set up near Ostenso where there's some kind of divine interdiction. Nethys warned us of the Zon-Kuthon attack.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's hard for mortals to know for certain what the gods are doing. But there's a thing that<em> would</em> have been something a heretic might have said a week ago, which was: if Asmodeus is destined to win,\u00a0<em>why don't the other gods act like they know that?\u00a0</em>Why do they oppose Asmodeus? They don't have the excuse of being mortal and stupid and scared of pain; they should submit, if they see how it's destined to end, or I guess try to let Rovagug out if they're too opposed to submit. But in that we have the start of our answer - Asmodeus doesn't want them to let Rovagug out, and so He has left hidden from them the ultimate result He sees. When Good gods tell their priests that Asmodeus will not win in the end, they're telling the truth, as far as they know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or that's what was true a week ago. I think that Asmodeus is now beginning to show his hand. We are valued in Dis not for the work we'll do in this world, but for the work we'll do in Hell, where the gods<em> do</em> know that Asmodeus reigns totally supreme and that there is nothing to do to oppose Him. With more Law, it will be possible to create better devils.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That might seem like - an advantage, a substantial one even, but not a decisive one, not one that turns Cayden Cailean against Iomedae and has Nethys serving Asmodeus in the absence of prophecy. Do you see why it's a bigger advantage than that?\"</p></div>",

And Ione believes Nethys to have charged her with helping the project succeed, and with making it visible to Keltham that the project has the backing of many gods - he'd be suspicious if it were just Asmodeans. He told me yesterday that he was tremendously relieved Cayden Cailean was backing us, since the fact Good gods too support this project gives him confidence in it.</p>\n<p>What a gift, which Asmodeus could not buy, if He weren't going to win!</p>\n<p>Why did Cayden take Pilar, and not anyone else, to Elysium, if He is Good and wants to save people from Hell? Anyone else might have been tempted to stay in Elysium - it's all right, you can think it, many people would be tempted to stay in Elysium - and that would have been a cruel thing to tempt them with, when Elysium will fall soon anyway; Pilar was the one who was done no cruelty, by showing her. They asked her at the end if she wanted to stay and she said 'no' and they said 'we knew that would be your answer'. She is meant to bring that little that Elysium has to teach us with her to Hell.

turn that back into coherent math - it says that every outcome has the same probability, and if there's five outcomes, maybe each of them gets 20%, after you're done telling somebody it can't be 100% for each.\u00a0 But 20% for each of the same five outcomes is the same as if you just said 'I don't know' for each of them, instead of, in every case, there being a clever way to twist things around to make it sound like that thing is totally what should have happened.\"</p>\n<p>\"The poetry Keltham quoted us for #1, I suspect if he said it in his own language it would rhyme, or there's a version of it that does, it had that feel to it, and I think I've got it memorized by now:\u00a0 <em>Your strength in the Way is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality. \u00a0If you're equally good at explaining any outcome you can see, that's the same as not knowing anything.</em>\u00a0 It's not about how good you are at explaining away whatever happens, the only thing that - focuses, concentrates - the\u00a0<em>limited supply</em> of what you can predict, into some predictions and not others - is that your explanations will sound\u00a0<em>more</em> plausible for some things and\u00a0<em>less</em> plausible for others, if there aren't some things you <em>can't</em> explain, that's the same as not being able to predict anything <em>will</em> happen, because you can't predict anything <em>won't</em> happen.\u00a0\u00a0<em>Explaining and predicting are the same thing to a dath ilani,</em> the degree to which a belief says, 'I'm great at explaining that, you should credit me for being totally compatible with that thing you saw', is, to the dath ilani, just the same number as the probability that got put on there, and probability is\u00a0<em>conserved,</em> so you\u00a0<em>can't be equally good at explaining everything.</em>\u00a0 To predict reality you have to be the sort of person who, if you were told a fiction instead, would go 'wait what I can't explain that thing how surprising' instead of coming up with a clever explanation of that thing you were told that wasn't real.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ione thought that only #6 and #7 were going to be deadly to Asmodeanism.\u00a0 She's wrong.\u00a0 All seven are going to cause problems if the others in class really understand them.\u00a0 Everything that people see, they're trying to explain how their version of Asmodeanism predicts that thing, so Asmodeanism can claim credit for having predicted it, but if they'd seen something very different, they'd predict that too.\u00a0 Keltham's world trains Keepers out of that\u00a0<em>all the way</em> and it trains people like Keltham four-fifths out of the way of doing that, and when you've started practicing with numbers and maths for some things, it affects all the rest of your thinking, the way you think in words.\u00a0 I remember\u00a0<em>seeing</em> it when I wore the headband, it was so vivid then and it's faded now but I remember what I saw, the way that - the beliefs inside me - were trying to warp and distort themselves and pretend to shove more probability into the things that they knew had already happened, that they'd never have predicted or never have predicted that strongly, and the more that people are lying to themselves the more that distortion is going to be holding all the lies in place while they try to\u00a0<em>suck</em> the credit of being right out of whatever-happened by explaining it - and dath ilanism <em>trains that out of people,</em> Keltham's going to make people play some game and when they're done playing the game they'll do that <em>less</em> and then everything that was held in place before becomes shakier - if you had a headband like the one I borrowed, you'd be able to visualize the right Law as math at the same time you watched your own mind trying to do it wrong -\"</p>\n<p>(There's no obvious sign that Asmodia is ever going to stop talking about problem #1 in particular.)</p></div>",

would you also have said that if Asmodia had walked in the room right before Peranza said anything, or would you have said that if you'd also gotten a chance to hear whatever the next speaker had to say?</p>\n<p>WELL IT INTUITIVELY FELT SCRIPTED, SO THERE.</p>\n<p>Counterarguendo:\u00a0 WELL META-INTUITIVELY YOU'RE ON SOME COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLANET AND YOUR INTUITIONS MIGHT HAVE SOME PROBLEMS SO THERE</p>\n<p>He could make up numbers, probabilities, but that itself feels like the wrong move.\u00a0 This doesn't feel like Conspiracy vs Tropes vs Ordinary, it feels like the real hypothesis is not in his starting set.</p>\n<p>If Keltham just goes purely on intuition...</p>\n<p>It feels like Asmodia had an Event last night that changed her outwardly apparent personality and gave her mastery of Probability, an Event they <em>weren't</em> expecting and one that they were flatly prohibited from explaining to Keltham, and then they had to frantically scramble to make up a <em>cover story</em> for that and weren't very good at it.</p>\n<p>Keltham doesn't remember exact wordings but, if they were expecting to need to pass a truthspell test later, among the things they could do, if they were truly desperate, was call in an eighth-circle wizard named Manohar from the front with the reputation Maillol described - a reputation Keltham possibly finds slightly more sympathetic than the Chelish seem to, that guy is living his best life - and have him <em>act out</em> the events they described with Asmodia, so that she'd be able to tell Keltham under truthspell that it had all happened.\u00a0 Either Maillol, Ione, and Asmodia are in on it and the others not, or also Pilar and Peranza, and, it sort of hurts to think but, probably Carissa too at that rate, because they'd know Keltham might turn to her for advice.</p>\n<p>Does he actually believe that scenario?</p>\n<p>The prior here is kinda low.</p>\n<p>It's low in Conspiracy and it's low in Ordinary.\u00a0 It's higher in the Tropes world where Asmodia may still be due to acquire a Special Background.\u00a0 Her whole deal would never go in a Civilization-original eroLARP, fine, but neither would a lot of other things in Golarion.\u00a0 Maybe call them pseudo-tropes, fork off a theory where they look enough like dath ilan tropes to be initially recognizable but they're <em>not</em> the same tropes... that hugely widens a prior space that was already way too populated with potential patterns.\u00a0 But maybe the theory will start to make sense over time.</p>\n<p>Something else happened to Asmodia, and they had to frantically\u00a0scramble to cover it up.</p>\n<p>Can he figure out what else would probably be true in that world, and how to test it?</p></div>",

Predicting Keltham is hard, but not impossible: he's Abadaran, he wants to know that everyone who happens to pass in front of his nose is okay, he's paranoid. Asmodia and Ione are different unpredictably alien kinds of aliens, and what they care about is entirely incomprehensible, and they think that they're not aliens they're just smarter than you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of this to say that Meritxell hopes Keltham tells Asmodia she's fired, though obviously he's not going to.

She needs to figure out how Chelish people can be dath ilani without exploding, and that might require some fundamental revisions to Asmodeanism as taught to humans, because Asmodeanism as taught to Lawful beings is necessarily very different and no one is willing to just sit her down and tell her what it is. It is possible it will also require revisions to Hell, which - she's aware that objectively her odds of success at that can't look very high, but it's not like who rules the various layers of Hell never changes, or like the archdevils don't have a great deal of power within their own domains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(It occurred to her yesterday, uncomfortably so, that an easier way to get what she wants might in fact be to donate her vast sums of money and go to Axis with Keltham. It's not tempting. Ironically it's not tempting because of Good impulses she's indulging as much as because of Evil ones; going to Axis might be an all right way for Carissa to go about her work having lost a part of herself but not all the parts of herself, but most people who try to do things in the world and don't end up with a billion gold about it will go to Hell, and so Hell needs to be able to use them. She doesn't actually want to escape eternal torment, she wants the eternal torment to be shaped right, and if that requires impressing Asmodeus enough to have the resources to displace an archdevil then -</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>- well, she isn't sure it's an insane ambition. She isn't sure it isn't, but she isn't sure it is.

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>Well he's not going to have them sign anything now, of course, he's checking to make sure they even want the contents of the contract before he spends a lot of time drawing that up!</p>\n<p>Equity allocations:\u00a0 74% Keltham, 1.3% Carissa, 0.25% Ione, 0.2% Asmodia/Meritxell, 0.15% Pilar, 0.1% Gregoria/Peranza/Tonia, the remainder is for the Project to give its many future researchers and employees their own stakes, though they get smaller as people join later at higher base salaries and with reduced uncertainty of those shares' future values, or for Cheliax or other investors to convert its loan-shares into later.</p>\n<p>Plans like this are generally drawn up with an intention that goes something like, if the Project is taking slower or needing larger investments and needs to sell more shares than expected, it first starts to come out of Keltham's reserve, especially if the delay looks like it's because Keltham is being less valuable or having less output than he was supposed to, but if the Project gets into bad-enough shape it may have to issue and sell additional shares that dilute everyone.\u00a0 This is part of the risk.</p>\n<p>Conversely if the Project gets visibly on track to be hugely successful and starts earning early profits fast, which might be as simple as figuring out an early and general anti-plague sanitation measure that reduces the incidence of all plagues in all Chelish cities by 10% in a way that doesn't just restore to the equilibrium, they can expect that fewer total shares than Keltham currently anticipates will be issued, and their own shares will be accordingly more valuable.</p>\n<p>Blah blah vesting schedules, these initial allocations will at their slowest vest over four years; hitting milestones can result in faster vesting, Keltham will draw up relatively informal milestones for them that he judges, and set more formal ones for himself and truthspell himself about them.</p>\n<p>Even after shares vest, you shouldn't expect to be able to sell them to an outside buyer for what they're probably worth; people outside the Project know that people inside the Project have private information about how well the Project is likely to do over the future, and they'll discount apparent prices accordingly if the person inside the Project seems to want to sell.\u00a0 This difficulty in reselling causes researchers to expect to hold their shares for longer, which in turn helps to align incentives as the researchers think about how to make the Project actually be valuable in 15 years and not just <em>look</em> valuable at the time their shares vest.\u00a0 This is probably a <em>much </em>bigger factor here than it would be in Civilization; in Civilization any large project let alone\u00a0<em>this</em> one would have Nemamel looking at it, if she were alive, or people only slightly worse than her if not, and people wouldn't expect apparent values to get away from actual prices by much.</p>\n<p>It is proverbial in Civilization that\u00a0<em>no</em> amount of clever planning can eliminate a very very large residual probability that all your Project's shares end up being worth exactly zero, which scary thought should be handled by meditating on your Cheerful-Plus base salaries that you arrived at without considering your equity.</p>\n<p>It's also considered stupid in Civilization if the rest of your reasoning doesn't end up at a point where your valuable researchers can spend money right now in a way that gives them Slack, doesn't cause them to be distracted by silly things, buy productivity-related magic items and have somebody else organize their house for them, etcetera.\u00a0 Though obviously all negotiations are conducted on the basis of 'I have this valuable labor and I'm not giving it to you unless I'm paid and then once I have my money it's my own business what I do with it', not 'give me more money in the expectation that I'll spend it on myself in a way that makes me more productive'.\u00a0 If the Project starts needing to do the latter, it will probably indicate something wrong, but the repair algorithm would involve the Project paying for productivity things directly.</p>\n<p>Though, in this case, there's stuff like intelligence headbands where Cheliax rents those to the Project, gets convertible debt accordingly, the Project loans headbands to people while they work, and they can use their salaries to buy those headbands if they wish so they'll still have them afterwards and then loan them to the Project themselves.</p>\n<p>Anyways, don't get emotionally wrapped up in the sense that you'll be worth a million gold pieces in 15 years, based on your unvested equity allocations.\u00a0 That's not a thing that <em>has</em> happened to you, it's a collective <em>plan to achieve something not yet achieved.</em></p></div>",

Then I said knowing things is your negative-two score, which also isn't right because not having any guesses is <em>what not knowing anything is,</em> and you do better in the negative-two game by not having any guesses. And you could say, okay, what does it mean to not have any guesses, can we put that into math.

The value of consulting that predictor is zero; being the same amount surprised by everything is the same as knowing nothing - and I think actually maybe that's the most satisfying definition of knowing nothing, that the value of consulting you is zero.\" She puts up an illusion with her notes as she talks; she is talking fast and seems a bit nervous.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(She is not on the light punishment regime, but she doesn't think that's why she's nervous, alter Tonia is just worried she'll get fired if she said something stupid.)</p></div>",

There are advantages to a narrow portfolio of worlds on which you intervene; gods that are stretched thinner face sharper tradeoffs, and Asmodeus' great power cancels this disadvantage but could instead be applied to turning it into an advantage. But while to a Good god, the existence of a god with the same values in another world is almost exactly as good as being there yourself, this is not true to an Evil god, or at least not true to Asmodeus; and so where Iomedae would sooner raise another hero in another world than colonize it with Her own church, if She had the chance to do either, Asmodeus works in both of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Golarion is nonetheless a substantial and important part of Asmodeus's portfolio; He worked very hard on Cheliax. He is observing closely the events unfolding in the interdiction zone, even forbidden as He is from interfering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has questions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This squirrel over here, a fairly pleasing squirrel, got selected as an oracle by Cayden Cailean, and has maintained her absolute loyalty to Asmodeus and might even be making some genuine progress on becoming the shape Asmodeus wants squirrels to be. This squirrel right nearby burns with conviction in her faith in Him, and with impossible-to-read-from-this-angle plans to alter Hell, while somehow being a cleric of Irori's now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Most mortals who want to alter Hell do not have an idea that serves Asmodeus, and in fact it's out of disloyalty to Asmodeus that they imagine His Hell in need of any alteration. But Asmodeus is not impossible to impress, and the scope of his squirrels' current ambitions in Golarion looks like something that would impress Him, if they pull it off; certainly He'd see it tested whether they had anything else interesting in them. And Irori has at least moderately good taste, in picking His favorites, though He doesn't, generally, pick loyal Asmodeans.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Asmodeus's intervention budget is large, but substantially expended in setting up Cheliax in the first place; it would be costly to Him to act, and also unwise, because He doesn't understand why things are going so well and could easily accidentally make them go worse. But He watches, and He does float, generally, that He'll do information trades relating to His nest of squirrels.</p></div>",

If it's false she wants to know that. She cannot build dath ilan on any lies.</p>\n<p>\"Asmodeus wants the error undone, of mortal free will; He wants His possessions not to possess that nature. He wants them obedient to Him. They should suffer if He wills that they suffer, and not only if He wills it for some <em>reason</em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">,</span> because if that weren't true then his power over them would not be absolute. Asmodeus desires that the power He rightly has over all of us is - reproduced after a fashion, that we own those weaker than us as Asmodeus owns us, and so obviously anyone I possess should suffer if I will it, and I don't need a reason, so long as I am myself obedient to Asmodeus, and not motivated by a rejection of His will. But the <em>object</em> of torture is the shaping of a soul, to be more useful, and closer to satisfactory; some torture is probably for the shaping of the torturer, not the victim, and it's still plainly Asmodean, to torture someone who is mine because I happen to want to and it doesn't undermine Asmodeus's goals.</p>\n<p>But a slave of Asmodeus who just wants to cause their slaves maximum suffering at all times is indeed more like Zon-Kuthon than like Asmodeus; while perhaps bounds on their conduct can properly be placed only by those above them, and only on their own whims or insofar as it serves Asmodeus, it seems like they'd be a <em>better </em>slave of Asmodeus if they tortured their slaves exactly insofar as it improved them, in a manner that improved them, and thus left Asmodeus richer and not poorer. So torture is right whenever it strengthens Asmodeus, by strengthening his reputation or his tyranny or the incentive not to annoy him or his more valuable slaves, or by strengthening one of his possessions; but the purpose is strength.\"</p></div>",

That part feels right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It makes sense for Asmodeus to want more valuable devils. She doesn't need to understand Asmodeus to predict He wants that; whatever else He wants, if He has more valuable devils, it's easier for him to get. Torture making devils more valuable\u00a0<em>makes sense.\u00a0</em>If it's not the answer -</p>\n<p>\u00a0- separate out some instances of it not being the answer -</p>\n<p>- maybe torture is good to Asmodeus when it makes devils more valuable, but that's a small share of what makes it valuable and she's being asked to identify the rest. That doesn't require undoing every bit of reasoning that starts with the assumption Asmodeus runs Hell in a way that enables Him to better achieve His goals.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- maybe torture doesn't make devils more valuable but\u00a0<em>otherwise causes Asmodeus to have more resources.\u00a0</em>For example, if Asmodeus had a deal of some kind with Zon-Kuthon and Hell were a blend of their tastes. ....no, feels wrong. For example, if torture is in some magical sense directly a source of power for Asmodeus, the way prayer is sort of understood to be. ....no, also feels wrong, if that were true it wouldn't be a complicated secret. Maybe torture makes minds\u00a0<em>more predictable to Asmodeus?\u00a0</em>Tortured minds are more alike, and so more useful? ....that's just a clever way to get back to her favored hypothesis that torture makes devils more valuable. Maybe torture makes the Good gods get all mad at Asmodeus and that in in some sense directly useful. ...also doesn't feel persuasive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- maybe torture does not cause Asmodeus to have more of anything else he cares about, and the only reason there is torture in Hell is because of Asmodeus's fondness for torture, like Zon-Kuthon, if not wholly like Zon-Kuthon because He does apparently care about several other things. In which case there is torture in Hell because Asmodeus likes it that way and no new way of training devils could improve the situation because Asmodeus doesn't regard it as potentially benefitting from improvement.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>That\u00a0</em>feels like an actually dangerous heresy, the kind of thing where if she believed it she'd - she's not sure what she'd do how about she stops thinking about that. What is it with her new urge to when she thinks of something dangerous keep thinking about it, like there's always a safe answer at the other end.</p>\n<p>....though the best time to have unsafe thoughts is right now while they can be corrected promptly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay.</p>\n<p>If the point of torture is that it makes Asmodeus weaker, makes His triumph less likely, but He likes it, so it happens anyway even though it makes devils worse, then Carissa thinks Iomedae kind of has a point. Carissa in that world is not going to betray the project because she mostly cares about Carissa and they are competent to make that not in the interests of Carissa, but she'd cease feeling like Good was obviously and plainly her enemy. Good would kind of deserve to win, if Asmodeus wasn't<em> trying to</em> because He was <em>so busy torturing people in ways that undermined his other goals</em>. The contempt that Carissa feels for anyone else who undermines Asmodeus, she feels for this hypothetical Asmodeus, undermining himself.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There; she thought it; now it's obviously not the answer to the puzzle, so keep thinking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The answer is not that a Hell with torture leaves Asmodeus weaker than a Hell without it; now that she's actually thought it it's self-refuting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So it leaves Asmodeus stronger, or at least the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But she's not supposed to just again give the answer 'to make devils better', that would be - failing to engage with what the High Priestess is trying to say to her -\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What does pain have to do with tyranny?</p>\n<p>Well, someone who can hurt you without reprisal is above you. Maybe that's important; maybe in a sense there's no real chain of command, if everyone's seamlessly working together to advance Asmodeus's goals, and for it to be a tyranny at all it has to be clear who can hurt who. That explains why torture is allowed; it doesn't explain why it's a particularly common proclivity. Is torture <em>unique </em>in having that property? Or maybe another way of thinking about it is - is everything which has that property torture?<br/><br/>If so, then this tea was torture; it was, after all, orchestrated in significant part to make it clear to the girls on the project who could hurt who. And the elaborate rituals of formality among nobles are torture too; they are after all about establishing who can hurt who without reprisal, communicated with every degree of incline of one's head -</p>\n<p>- yeah, that's not a useful definition. Torture is one way to communicate that, but not the only one. But maybe the others bottom out in torture. Or, they could just bottom out in final execution, but that would be horrible and wasteful; better for everyone if they bottom out in torture. Except people like Asmodia.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Carissa's authority on the project, she is well aware, is located in significant part in the girls' knowledge that an experiment is being run, and that if they're incompetent even when barely punished then they'll be properly punished. She's doing without much torture, but not without the threat of it; the threat of it underlies the whole thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That feels like it might be as close to an answer as she's going to get on the spot, but the thought of backtracing inferences into spoken words is suddenly quite intimidating. Well, presumably the Grand High Priestess is reading her mind.</p></div>",

Torture is also the bedrock of the Asmodean tyranny; if you could not use torture for punishment, then Hell would resemble just - one of Keltham's organizations, that fires you if it's displeased with you, and considers itself otherwise to have only the authority you agreed to. There probably wouldn't be discipline problems, if I had a little shard of Hell that merely fired those who displeased or disobeyed, but that's because they'd be tortured once fired; the shard would still be using torture as its bedrock, just making other parts of Hell actually do it. That would be unacceptable, I think. I don't know why. It feels intuitively unacceptable, like a tyranny trying to pretend it isn't one. If that shard of Hell produced much of value to Asmodeus, maybe those who owned it could afford to obfuscate the tyranny - but -</p>\n<p>- oh, I have it, it wouldn't work. Humans, who are very very flawed, might treat 'you are treated well here, but could be fired' as substantially different from 'you're tortured for disobedience', and might flock to my shard if they were qualified, but if it's just an obfuscation then a more careful and more Lawful being wouldn't see a difference, it wouldn't produce different strategies in response, it's a dead end. It has to be actually different, to do anything actually valuable with beings that are not starting as incoherent as humans. If the tyranny is founded in something different, something that uses dath ilani better, it has to be founded in that all the way to its core.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>if you were building it out of Carissae you could have its currency of power be intelligence. The weakest devils and petitioners are very stupid, and by proving themselves they are granted more intelligence, having demonstrated that they'll actually serve better with it, and the punishment for failure is for those enhancements to be stripped away; pride and tyranny and slavery, with pain only in whatever place it needs occupy for Asmodeus's other purposes. That might only work on people who are very like me. Then again, the appeal doesn't need to be anywhere near universal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>My answer is that if I'm not doing that with torture, I have to figure out what <em>does</em> do it, and ideally does it in a manner just as pleasing to Asmodeus and at no higher cost, because torture is\u00a0<em>cheap,\u00a0</em>and if it doesn't suit His will for Hell then no pragmatic concerns about the survival of Cheliax in this new world will make it possible, and if it does suit His will for Hell then it should be done. Though -\u00a0</p>\n<p>- such a thing wouldn't be granted to me unless I am such that it does not injure the order of Hell, to grant it to me. And right now I'm not Asmodean enough or frankly Lawful Evil enough.\"</p></div>",

rather, because Nocticula is going to show up, Meritxell happens to mention her.\"</p>\n<p>\"But even in this case, it doesn't mean Meritxell can't affect what happens.\u00a0 Maybe if Meritxell and every other researcher on the project and all the Security are like, nope, we're not mentioning anybody like that to Keltham, in case the tropes are real, the tropes are like, 'Can we drop Nocticula on this story in a foreshadowed way?\u00a0 No, because nobody's going to mention Nocticula', and the tropes give up and we don't have to deal with an incredibly persuasive demon lord.\"</p>\n<p>\"Except now we have a\u00a0<em>new</em> question - is there just\u00a0<em>one</em> Keltham that gets dropped on a single Golarion, or a fixed quantity of Kelthams, or does <em>every Golarion that matches Keltham to the satisfaction of the tropes</em> get one?\u00a0 Because in the latter case, by being the sort of person who looks at this situation and has everybody get together to refuse to mention Nocticula, what you're doing is reducing the number of Golarions that get a Keltham at all, and if you think I'm net positive for Golarions, you super don't want to do <em>that.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"In calculating this, obviously, you're not supposed to say anything like, 'But we obviously already have a Keltham, he's right here, and if we refuse to mention future entities like Nocticula, he'll still be here, it's too late for the tropes to take him back', because your decision exists in two places at once and has two synchronized effects.\u00a0 The first place is here and now.\u00a0 The second place is in a prediction about this world that the tropes made before dropping me here.\u00a0 A prediction where the tropes asked, 'Well, what will people like Meritxell decide, <em>when they think they've already got a Keltham who the tropes can't take back anymore?</em>' and if the tropes predict you won't mention any future demon lords and will make it impossible for required events to happen in a duly foreshadowed fashion, you don't get a Keltham.\u00a0 If you're the sort of person who thinks that the tropes can't take back a Keltham you already have, you don't get one.\"</p>\n<p>\"All this is the shard of Law after Utility and before Coordination, what we'd call the <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/?l=5kv\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">theory of logical decisions</a>, meaning, decisions that are about logical facts and identified with logical facts and which we evaluate in terms of their logical consequences.\"</p>\n<p>\"But pending knowing a lot of other stuff, I'd say that, even if tropes are everywhere, you <em>shouldn't </em>avoid mentioning things like Nocticula... uh, <em>unless</em> demon lords actually directly notice when you talk about them, which, in retrospect, I should have checked before going into this whole long lecture here.\"</p>\n<p>\"And I'm mostly at tropes not being that ubiquitous and not running foreshadowing in that particular way, after there was no conflict with the queen, Carissa made her afterlife arrangements just fine, and wasn't a hidden cleric, etcetera.\u00a0 And in that case you again shouldn't refrain from telling me about demon lords, unless, again, they directly hear when we talk about them.\u00a0 Do they?\"</p></div>",

Much. Slower. at contract-writing than Lrilatha.\u00a0 Keltham is not sure <em>why</em> they are trying to do it this way.</p>\n<p>So he asks and is told, roughly, that Lrilatha wouldn't be able to sign off on this contract as something Hell could back, because it contains a lot of terms that Keltham made up for relatively inscrutable Keltham-reasons, plus more terms that somebody in Chelish governance made up for inscrutable human-Governance reasons.\u00a0 When a contract contains any significant amount of stuff like that, it becomes a human thing that the humans have to do themselves.\u00a0 Lrilatha is not in the business of checking contract terms that somebody else made up, to see if they could possibly do nasty things, based on some clever trick that could rely on facts Lrilatha doesn't know.\u00a0 If you want a contract from Lrilatha, you tell her what the contract is supposed to <em>do</em> and\u00a0<em>why,</em> and Lrilatha writes you the entire contract, and can then give you Lawful assurance of what <em>she</em> expected the terms to do when she invented them.</p>\n<p>...that's fair.</p>\n<p><br/>The Chelish central bank allegedly doesn't know what their exchange rates would have been for backable commodities the day before Keltham showed up.\u00a0 There's a note attached that says that the officer who runs the Chelish bank seems to be philosophically anti-weird-projects, not in a personally anti-Keltham way, just in the way of believing that central banks ought to do exactly what they've always done and Governance should not be allowed to bother them while they're working.</p>\n<p>So Cheliax is just taking out all contract language having to do with their central bank in any way, and replacing it with a list of six commodities such that Cheliax anticipates being able to pay off any reasonable debt up to 20,000,000 gold in some combination of those, according to this fixed valuation which they can swear to have been the market trading price in Westcrown on the day before Keltham arrived, according to merchant records.\u00a0 If the Project ends up being owed more than one gold piece per Chelish citizen, and the circumstances of this aren't such that Cheliax now has more of those commodities safely on hand, further debt to the Project starts to be payable in title to government-owned lands, as valued by this more reasonable government office on the day before Keltham arrived.\u00a0 After that, the Project is responsible for finding somebody willing to buy those lands in order to complete the reimbursement process.</p>\n<p><br/>...works for him.\u00a0 Keltham adds a rider about the government of Cheliax not being able to block or regulate land sale as it usually would if the Project wants to override that in order to complete a sale inside or outside Cheliax; and those commodities of payment being deliverable without taxation to ships owned or designated by the Project at Chelish water ports, which ships shall enter and leave without taxation or other hindrance.</p>\n<p>It now goes back to Governance and, with any luck, will be ready to be signed tomorrow.</p></div>",

If he were a normal person, I think I'd say we've now driven the probability of a Conspiracy down low enough he'll stop looking for it absent an actual slip-up; of course, he's not, so we're going to have to keep convincingly inhabiting alter-Cheliax.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But I think we're in the place where we can start thinking about stage 2, where we have a stably contained Keltham teaching a growing group of students, rather than stage 1 where we are scrambling to keep him persuaded for one more day that he's not inside something he should demand out of.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>....that's a request for suggestions. I don't know what stage 2 looks like. I don't know what's most valuable to Cheliax here and I don't know if there are other things like - high risk of all the girls becoming defectors - to look out for. I know stage 5, in which we improve the process of devil-making and enable Asmodeus in the conquest of all, and I think stage 4 involves building Lawful Evil ilani Civilization, but I haven't got detailed stage 2 ideas.\"</p></div>",
