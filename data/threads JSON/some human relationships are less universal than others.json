You can feel it, as a wizard, whether your mind is still sticky with yesterday's magic. Eight hours is the rule of thumb, but people do vary; some need a little less, some a little more. Carissa is about average.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Until her Ring of Sustenance kicks in, in five more days. She's carefully not thinking about how many things can happen in five days.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br/>She's in her own bed, not Keltham's, because she didn't want to wake him up slipping into bed, or explain to him why she was out so late. She didn't help clean up the confetti, that's beneath her dignity, but she did help Maillol get through the entire backlog of project-related paperwork. If she was stupid enough to march up to Aspexia Rugatonn and ask for a desk job, she had better sit at a desk and do it. It took well into the night, involved ordering the spending of more money than she's ever seen or dreamed about, and left her very stressed about all the ways her Keltham could still escape or be taken from her. At one point somebody actually did come by to check if she was secretly a cleric and didn't know it. But they were all squared away, by the time she went off to bed, for the relocation in the morning. Shortly after dawn, as soon as the Forbiddance was up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The light filtering through into the adorable little courtyard suggests it's well past dawn, so probably that has already happened. Unless the fortress turned out to contain a secret tunnel to the Underdark, or Aspexia Rugatonn was assassinated in the dead of night, or they've gotten an order directly from Asmodeus to relocate the project directly to Dis instead. You never know, on Project Lawful.\u00a0</p></div>",

Send them all to the Worldwound, see what they need then. Project security at the villa was barely, barely competent to keep things from slipping and Security at the palace, even before you took everybody north this morning, was notably worse. Aspexia thought we could make the best of there being rumors about me, but I'm scryable, and frequently in a room with Keltham, it's actually a terrible idea for Lastwall to think I'm interesting!! Maybe the best of our terrible options at that point but an incredibly massive security failure which everyone was just casually indifferent about! Maillol would have done better, but at the palace he doesn't even really use his brain, because he expects everything to run on stupid games he's not good at. You should have your fucking capital at the Worldwound, is what you should do, nothing less than the dumb ones getting eaten by demons makes people realize they aren't\u00a0<em>special.\u00a0</em>Cheliax has been around for eighty years and doesn't know how to punish people in a way that makes them better at their jobs, what are we\u00a0<em>doing?
