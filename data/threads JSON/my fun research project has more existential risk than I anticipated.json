This punishment isn't about making them stronger, though we of course can't actually afford to have them weaker for very long; it's about following through so that next time we need them desperate and pressured and scared we can credibly deliver them into that state.

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>Where Keltham was actually going with this is that burning fuel does not\u00a0<em>raise the surrounding temperature by a constant amount.</em>\u00a0 Chemical reactions don't produce a\u00a0<em>particular temperature.</em>\u00a0 They produce\u00a0<em>heat...</em></p>\n<p>...He should probably actually define those things.\u00a0 Temperature is how hot or cold something is, the average speed of the randomly vibrating molecules inside it.\u00a0 Heat is, abstractly, the energy you add to make molecules vibrate faster and the temperature go up.\u00a0 Heat flows from hotter things to colder things because the molecules in contact bump into each other, and the slow molecules slow down the faster ones in the collision, and the fast molecules speed up the slower ones in the collision.</p>\n<p>So if you put colder fuel into a fire, more of that heat gets used up to heat the materials of the fuel itself, and the resulting temperature is lower.</p>\n<p>The same thing goes for blowing colder air onto the fire - oh, air carries Element-8, which is a constituent in most ways that fuels made from the remains of living things, like wood or coal, rearrange themselves tighter and release heat, because living things have a lot of Element-6 that binds tightly to Element-8, among other things - so you have to allow air into a fire to let it go on burning - but if it's colder air, the resulting fire will have a lower temperature.</p>\n<p>Nobody has gotten Keltham any proper experts on metal forging to talk to, but the very preliminary glances he's had out of a couple of books, suggest that they are not trying to warm the air or fuel before burning it, which means that the reaction needs to use more fuel or more powerful fuel than is financially optimal.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>One way to warm up the air and fuel is the reverse-flow method, where you take the exhausted air from the burning-chamber and run that past the incoming air, so heat gets transferred from the exhausted air to the fresh air.\u00a0 You can also do that to warm up the fuel before burning.</p>\n<p>The other method, this being Golarion, might be to 'bind' a 'fire elemental', the same thing that powered hot water in the villa and presumably powers it here in this fortress, and get it to heat the fuel and air separately before they combust.</p>\n<p>Given that forges don't just run off fire elementals in the first place, Keltham is guessing that fire elementals have a <em>temperature</em> rather than a\u00a0<em>heat output,</em> and that this maximum temperature is too low to melt metal.\u00a0 When you burn coal or other fuel, that in principle can just keep adding more and more heat, because the molecules go on rearranging themselves tighter, and that energy is conserved and must go somewhere.\u00a0 The limiting factors are the starting temperature of the fuel and air; and heat that gets lost into the environment, which gets lost faster the higher the temperature goes.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Keltham is guessing that, once a fire elemental gets up to a certain temperature, it doesn't add any more heat than that.</p>\n<p>So you need to use coal or other fuel, not just a fire elemental, to get a temperature high enough to refine iron ore or forge steel.</p>\n<p>But people may not have realized that a forge could use <em>less</em> fuel, and maybe less expensive fuel, if they used a fire elemental to first heat up the ores, fuels, and airs, as high as the fire elemental's temperature, and maybe then used some reverse-flow from the furnace exhausts to heat the inputs higher than that, before finally adding the fixed amount of heat from the fuel-burning reaction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of this does presume that fuel costs are significant at all in forged metal costs.\u00a0 Which is an example of why Keltham needs to talk to some <em>actual folks currently making and selling metal, at scale, </em>in order to make any progress here.</p>\n<p>Or if no single refinery or forge in Cheliax uses enough fuel to make it worth the cost of adding a fire elemental, Keltham is going to have to introduce the concept of \"economies of scale\", which is when you have a large-enough refinery or forge to make it worth adding a fire elemental.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Just to state the obvious out loud, all these ideas, should they not already be in circulation, are covered by the compact the Project has signed with Cheliax; and may not be used within Cheliax except by paying the Project enormous patentgratuities on them; and are to be held under lesser-but-real conditions of Security, so as to lengthen the amount of time they may be profited-from before Chaotic people start using them without paying patentgratuities and thus undercutting the market.</p></div>",

Firstly, you need a number of people doing military operations for every one directly stabbing demons with sharp sticks or hitting them with spells. You need people providing healing, armor, weapons, communications, bringing food and water to the front lines, digging fortifications, guarding the camps. You can have very small strike forces of four or five powerful spellcasters with no logistics network behind them, doing a single day of operations and then teleporting to safety at the end of it, but if you're moving any real numbers of troops or if you want to hold a position you generally want ten people who do all that work for every one who is directly fighting. Secondly, the way you get a few powerful casters is by having lots and lots of weak casters try to fight. Some of them die, some of them stall out, some of them make it; Cheliax does that too, though without conscription. Lastwall doesn't care if people die, except insofar as they are weaker for it; Heaven is understood to be nicer than this world anyway. So sending off a hundred conscripts one of which will return as a powerful spellcaster and the rest of whom will die is a perfectly good deal.</p>\n<p>For earning power - foreign connections, mostly? The younger son of a noble in Taldor has lots of money but no title, so he decides to go to Lastwall and lead a little soir\u00e9e into Ustalav, and if it succeeds, then he's got some land, and can rent it to people, and can buy respectability and exemptions from the laws. And if it fails then his money is inherited by<em> his </em>younger brother who can have his own try.\"</p></div>",

A lot of maneuvers only work if all the soldiers do exactly what they're told.

There is a lot of government scheming. Cheliax changed Kings four times in my mother's life. Everyone who was King was terrified of being assassinated in a fashion that didn't leave them resurrectable, and so they'd do harsh and arbitrary things that seemed to them to make it less likely they'd be assassinated. It was rumored they used mind control a lot. It was impossible to know if that was true, or really what was true in general about the people in power, but people didn't mind, because it was possible to know - that the ports were growing, that foreign invasions weren't likely. There being lots of scheming for power only really matters to most people when two contestants go to a proper war about it, in which cities are destroyed and tens of thousands of people die.\"</p></div>",

Almost no one, in Cheliax before the Church took over, was a wizard, or would train you to be a wizard. 'Tell your daughters not to have sex until they were second circle wizards' was absurd and unviable. Not for my mother, who's a wizard herself, learned from her own father, but there were maybe five women like her in Corentyn. You couldn't send your daughter to school to be a wizard. You could send her to an apprenticeship, but - that would be sending her off to be vulnerable -\u00a0<em>ugh, I'm frustrated now, concepts keep having prerequisites -</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>- for most people, 'wait until you're a second circle wizard' is an impossible rule. It was not a life path people who didn't happen to get very lucky could reasonably hope to follow. So the advice instead was usually to wait until you are married to a man who has enough money to support you and the children, and contractually obligated to do that. And that is what most reasonable girls would do, if they had any self control or common sense.\"</p></div>",

Because it's inherently appalling and because why would you want to make them richer even if you could.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So - he's this cautious when<em> not </em>warned that Cheliax usually writes deceptive or manipulative contracts, or this is standard language where he's from, and he's very financially sophisticated. We knew his civilization was very financially sophisticated, but he must individually work in contracts within it, to have been able to reproduce all this from memory, or else have some way to access its information and records, or to speak - perhaps via Sending - with the people of his home world. If he has that I'm guessing it's very limited - Sending would be limited enough - because he would hire a bunch of advisors there to review everything, if it weren't too limited, and they'd have caught Cheliax in a lie by now.\"</p></div>",

And we might not have to hold on all that long before we can decisively defeat Osirion in a war - actually, let's have that as a category of project considerations we're tracking separately. What's the size of Cheliax's economic and military advantage, what's the amount of military technology Keltham now holds inside him to unleash fast, how close are we to the state where, if Keltham goes to Osirion, we can just conquer it? If spellsilver's a tenth as expensive, and we get a year's head start, then we can win a war before Osirion has the chance to do any spellsilver refining.\"</p></div>",

the discovery and invention of new knowledge of the world; the travel and discovery of other worlds beyond Golarion, or witnessing their strangeness brought here.</p>\n<p>2. \u00a0Nethys is god of magic. \u00a0Knowing more magic makes you a better person. \u00a0Not all higher-circle wizards are superior to lower-circle wizards, however, and authority does not strictly follow power.\u00a0 There are also matters of skill and research to consider, and matters of service and heresy towards Him.</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 Nethys is god of <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">destruction</span> explosions.\u00a0 The proper fate of all things is to explode.\u00a0 Anything that doesn't explode will sooner or later change its shape and form, and become part of something else that does explode.\u00a0 It is heresy to suggest that anything cannot or should not explode; but it is not heretical to make it to explode later rather than sooner, or explode in one manner rather than another.\u00a0 Nethys's worshippers need not be eager to explode themselves.</p>\n<p>4.\u00a0 Nethys is god of <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">madness</span> diverse ways of thinking.\u00a0 Madness can be seen as knowledge corrupted, insanity can be seen as a mind exploded, and so Nethys holds jurisdiction there as well.\u00a0 The faithful of Nethys are granted dominion over madness as they are granted dominion over knowledge, and may, according to their own whim or kindness, choose to guard others from such, who do not see how their own minds are bound for explosion.</p>\n<p>5.\u00a0 Nethys is greatest of gods.\u00a0 As the god of knowledge, He is the only being in the multiverse who actually knows what the fuck He is doing.\u00a0 All other beings, mortals and gods alike, stumble in the dark, except insofar as the god of knowledge chooses to enlighten them of a role they have to play in one of Nethys's vast plans.\u00a0 Nethys's eventual triumph over all other gods is inevitable, given His domain.</p>\n<p>6.\u00a0 Nethys is a kindly god who only hurts His worshippers as is needful to accomplish His goals, never for the sake of cruelty.\u00a0 He does not shatter the minds of His believers unless they betray Him and refuse His evident intentions, and protects them from the grimmest fates while they are about His work, to maintain clear incentives for them.\u00a0 At the end of their lives, those worthy of Him, which is not an unreasonably difficult bar to surpass, will go to His afterlife in which all knowledge is contained in vast libraries, there to study magic ever after with nobody torturing them even a little.</p>\n<p>7.\u00a0 The appropriate attitude of a Nethysian toward her inferiors within or without the faith, is not cruelty, but smugness in her superior knowingness.\u00a0 Nethys is the greatest and smuggest of the gods.\u00a0 All other beings know less than Him and are therefore inferior and deserving of His smugness.\u00a0 When Nethys has inevitably conquered all that there is, His true faithful will get to tell everyone that they were right all along and they told them so.\u00a0 Nobody will get turned into a paving stone.</p>\n<p>8.\u00a0 As the greatest and smuggest of the gods, knowing far more than His lessers, the touch of Nethys is too fearsome for a mortal mind to withstand.\u00a0 Asmodeans lie and pretend that this is because Nethys is mad Himself and not merely god over madness, to discourage prayer to him.\u00a0 This is not so; Nethys is simply greater and knows deadlier secrets than those other gods which can touch upon mortals more lightly.</p>\n<p>9.\u00a0 The ultimate end of the multiverse is that it will explode in the most glorious explosion that there has ever been.\u00a0 Nethys and His faithful alone will know it and witness it, before they, too, having already learned all things, explode.</p>\n<p>10.\u00a0 Nethys's oracle is Chosen and Blessed of Nethys.\u00a0 Whomsoever would injure Nethys's dignity through her or block her performance of her duties will find, despite all precautions they attempted to take, that Nethys has perfectly foreseen their futile evasions (see doctrine #1) and arranged an appropriately retributive explosion (see doctrine #3).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Submitted by Ione Sala to those Asmodeans concealing from her whatever actual doctrines of Nethys may exist, in the clear communication that to maintain Cheliax's Conspiracy she must maintain some coherent presentation of Nethysian doctrine to Keltham, and the rest of the Conspiracy must be consistent with it, and even so it is one more lie of alterCheliax and in her own opinion a needless one.</em></p>\n<p><em>Ione will, in due consideration of the Conspiracy's purposes, attempt to construct, from this base, an alter-version, being the Doctrines of AlterNethys, such as may be more gently presented to Keltham.\u00a0 She will endeavor there to conceal or downplay all points regarding Nethys's moral and strategic superiority over lesser gods, and those greater trends favoring Him.</em></p>\n<p><em>Should, however, the entire basis of her guessed theology, be wrong in such fashion as may prove harmful to Cheliax's Conspiracy, Ione Sala encourages her superiors to swear and attest to her regarding the actual doctrines of her faith; that she may better serve Nethys, and, through serving Him alone, aid also Cheliax.</em></p></div>",

In other places it is elsewise.</p>\n<p>Iomedae is the god of the war on that which has no concern for our values and cannot be bargained with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The creatures born natively of the Abyss, which pour through the Worldwound into Golarion, are Chaotic Evil, and not in the way that humans who read Chaotic Evil are Chaotic Evil; their values are Evil, not some blend of Evil and Good. An Evil human, even a Chaotic Evil human who values none of the habits of coordination that can build civilization in the absence of Good, won't generally murder someone for a copper piece; demons would. The native inhabitants of Abaddon <em>eat souls,\u00a0</em>and this they do because the souls are tasty.</p>\n<p>It is said that long ago, when the asuras native to Hell ruled there, it was similar with them, and Asmodeus alone possessed the skill to bargain with them across that gap, so much wider than the gap ordinary bargains must cross; and when He purchased the asuras's departure He had the backing of Good, for his promise to make His devils out of the living. But it might be said falsely; the gods hold information about the god-agreements of the ancient past very dear, and it was long before Iomedae's time.</p>\n<p>In Cheliax I think the telling of uncertain-stories about ancient god-agreements is discouraged, lest people remember something false and run off with it; but while I do not confidently assess that the risk of that, with you, is none, if you are of a different Civilization entirely then it is beyond my wisdom to guess your errors, and the best I can do is tell you things that lead people often to error, and warn you that they often do that.\"</p></div>",

The Church of Desna would say that Desna values, for every agent, that it attain its own priorities whatever they are, which makes Her friendly to humans, though also friendly to demons and useless in the war on Evil.

Those are all things that happened, but they aren't the operative ingredients of the thing that happened.

It's unpleasant, so it's serving one of the purposes of punishment. It can drive her to the state of miserable desperation where she wishes she had not erred. It is obviously a satisfactory response.

It feels unsatisfactory, as a result to 'how do you make Carissa better', like, you'd never come up with that if you were starting from\u00a0scratch -</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If she were starting from scratch, and someone thought disrespectfully about Asmodeus, what would she do, after she explained their error? Maybe have them talk to a devil much smarter than them, and be punished for every error in their understanding; that seems like it'd inculcate the appropriate sense of how those who command us are wiser than us, and have thought more deeply, and we should not assume them stupid. But she's already got a bit of a problem where punishments need to feel big and dramatic to suit her, and that's simply not sustainable on a society-wide scale....</p></div>",

You don't get the Starstone by standing at the moat daydreaming about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What things can you at least sometimes get from torture.</p>\n<p>- person regrets having done the thing they did. In this specific case Carissa already regrets it because it was incorrect; she isn't sure she needs additional regretting it</p>\n<p>- no, better to think, she isn't sure why she needs additional regretting it. What does regretting it past the point of having been corrected achieve? Possibly it inculcates habits against similar mistakes? Not only will you not make this mistake again, you won't make related mistakes either? Or maybe there's something like - you have both a conscious and a subconscious system for arriving at beliefs, and arguments speak to the conscious one, and pain speaks to the unconscious one, and to actually stop making mistakes you need them corrected on both levels? That feels - right, it feels like the sort of premise you could build something like Cheliax on and explain it to someone like Keltham, so assume for now it's true -</p>\n<p>- the dumbest most straightforward kind of punishment to align the subconscious with truth would be, when you think something wrong, you instantly receive a painful shock, until your brain learns not to have thoughts like that. Unfortunately Cheliax doesn't have the resources to deliver punishments instantly, which is why much of what punishment is must be internalized - you instantaneously feel a sense of terror at the thought you just had, and unpleasant anticipation. of the eventual punishment, and that dread is what keeps your mind in line with truth. And then the actual punishment is just to deliver on the promise and keep the dread around for next time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- but there seems to be a problem with that? Peranza's problem could be diagnosed in part as that she has installed self-punishment for so many of her thoughts that even when she's allowed to think them she\u00a0<em>can't,\u00a0</em>and everyone thinks she's at the highest risk of having a meltdown and becoming unsalvageable. So punishment needs to be designed to avoid the failure mode where the subconscious correction fires excessively, even at thoughts that are necessary for achieving Asmodeus's goals. Possibly Cheliax as it exists now isn't very good at avoiding this failure mode because it only comes up when you drop someone into a context sufficiently far outside the one they're familiar with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Pilar doesn't flinch with dread or terror from any of her thoughts, and is a very good Asmodean. She knows she'll be punished sometimes, but she doesn't mind that; her internal attitude towards it is not one of dread. That seems <em>better.\u00a0</em>How do you get\u00a0<em>that.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>- Carissa seems to have dismantled lots of her very important internal processes for punishing herself for thoughts. Some of this she did at Abrogail's behest, because thoughts and feelings are tied closely together and Abrogail wanted her to stop looking away from her feelings. Some of this she did because the flinches kept getting in the way of figuring out how to do her job. That does put her, though, in a dangerous position; she might fail to flinch away from something she was\u00a0<em>really really supposed to\u00a0</em>flinch away from, and end up condemning Asmodeus. It is worth hurting herself very badly, to avoid that. It's just not obvious what kind of hurting her will in fact avoid that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- She feels like this is an extremely hard case for punishment and not actually a particularly good place to teach her how punishment works! It makes sense for her to be assigning and conducting torture sessions for normal people who it won't be a catastrophe to punish either excessively or insufficiently but it seems like really, someone qualified should be assigning torture sessions to an extremely complicated case who it's catastrophic to err with!\u00a0</p></div>",

He desires to trade openly and honestly with all who will deal honestly with him. He wants to ensure that the knowledge he has of dath ilan benefits everyone in Golarion, not because he thinks of himself as Good in his own right but because he got that knowledge free from dath ilan, and feels obliged to spend it how they would see fit, were they here. Dath ilan is <em>unbearably\u00a0</em>Lawful Good, having engineered their society in that direction with every tool you might think of plus some you did not know were possible, like heritage-optimization. This is what makes alter-Cheliax necessary; the real Cheliax, Keltham would not trade with, and he'd kill himself and go to Osirion if he came to consider it likely he is being deceived.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alter-Cheliax is a harder problem than you think, which is why Asmodia has absolute license to correct and train you in inhabiting it. If Cheliax were ruled by Abadar, how much would fifth-circle wizards be paid? You don't know? Keltham wants to know right now, what's your guess? It'd be strange to not have a guess. You might think your guess can't be\u00a0<em>wrong;\u00a0</em>after all, nowhere is Cheliax ruled by Abadar, and so it's the sort of thing that can't be known except maybe somehow to Nethys. But your guess can be inconsistent, with what Keltham understands of the productive economic contributions of wizards, and their scarcity, and who pays them, and how many Security are assigned to Project Lawful. If your number is too low then the salaries Keltham has been quoted for the project don't make any sense and teleportation ought to be more accessible and it's more suspicious that there isn't immigration to Cheliax from Osirion or Taldor. If your number is too high, then the logistics of staffing the Worldwound don't make any sense and the expected revenue from spellsilver improvements ought to be a lot higher.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why not just give him the real number? Because in Cheliax fifth-circle wizards needs must have sold their soul, and that wouldn't be true in alter-Cheliax, and it<em> changes the numbers.</em></p>\n<p>Everything is like this. The core art that dath ilan teaches is the art of seeing all the world as a single, interconnected web, every strand of which tugs directly or indirectly on every other strand. Dath ilani are trained in seeing how a tug on one thing - one price, one technology, one number quoted in one book - ought to imply things far across the web about Governance and intelligence distributions and metal refining. There are no safe lies to Keltham because we do not know all the content of the lies we're telling, and there are no safe truths because truth is entangled with the fact that Cheliax is run by Asmodeus and not by Abadar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dath ilan is probably run by an Evil conspiracy of its own, of course. But we cannot contact them, and if we could they'd crush us utterly and repurpose us to their own ends whatever they are.\"</p></div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>\"There are a number of errors I anticipate from new additions to this project. One is reasoning too much about why all of the absurd scary things you've been told are less absurd, or less scary, and should not transform all your thinking quite as much as they might look like they should. You might reason, for example, that every secret project in Cheliax probably had ambitions of world domination, that the stakes are probably not quite as high as that, that Hell might tell us falsely of our great value, that nothing you hear is ever really true and so nothing I say should really sway you all that far from whatever posture you walked in with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last time I spoke of the unique importance of this project, and the unimaginable rewards for successful service, Her Majesty arrived to confirm that the project was as important as claimed, and the rewards as real. It is my sincere hope that we will not need to\u00a0<em>repeatedly waste her time</em> because no one can believe the stakes are real without her personal attention. You will have to unlearn the habit of not believing things; I will assist you, in that, by not saying them unless they are true. Lies are the poor substitute that Cheliax uses on people too stupid to make correct inferences from the truth anyway, employed <em>by\u00a0</em>people themselves too stupid to think of truth and lies as fundamentally different things. On Project Lawful we are attempting to make you competent to make correct inferences from the truth, and that requires telling it.</p>\n<p>You may have heard that there is a lot of heresy on Project Lawful. There is more than you thought, even after Asmodia just introduced you to our resident Nethysian and our resident cursed by Cayden Cailean. The core heresy of Project Lawful is this: the project is premised on the idea that some people can think true things, unabashed, untrained in hiding from all their thoughts with frightening implications, possessed with\u00a0<em>real competence at thinking,\u00a0</em>and still be Asmodeans. That means that you are going to have to try thinking, and some of your thoughts will be heresy, and you will have to\u00a0<em>keep thinking\u00a0</em>instead of\u00a0<em>stopping.</em></p>\n<p>This is definitely going to destroy some of you. Those more pessimistic than I think it will destroy all of us in the end except Pilar. Even if it is so that people can think true things and still be Asmodeans, no one has yet tried to construct an Asmodeanism made up entirely of true things, and you'll find yourself believing a bunch of nonsense that doesn't hold together, and then some of you will panic and throw it out. I'm pretty sure there is a beautiful consistent comprehensible truth on the other side, and I am perhaps Chosen by Asmodeus for this work, and I still sometimes find myself lost in what are definitely heresies, in Asmodeus's sight.</p>\n<p>The important thing is to keep in mind that errors, while they will be consistently corrected, are only catastrophic if they happen in Keltham's view. Your minds are being constantly read, your loyalty is being closely monitored, but your punishments will be tailored narrowly towards improving your performance, so long as your errors are not deliberate betrayals. You are valuable; I will soon own the rights to your souls; I want you to be stronger and better. I want you to be the best of Cheliax and to grow into the best of Hell.\"</p></div>",

The only thing Cheliax is achieving is making themselves perfectly legible to You, and doing their small part to rebuild Prophecy out of contracts so as to restore it to Abadar. But they almost certainly got the idea from Keltham, and that is almost certainly because Keltham's world has it; it's one of the early things you'd reinvent, if you were reinventing, and it's not something you'd invent like this from scratch if you weren't accustomed to it. So prediction markets work, which is why Keltham told Cheliax about them, and Cheliax knows they're ill-equipped to lie to Keltham, which is why they now set up their own presumably-secret markets on whatever the markets are on.\"</p></div>",

Because of course walking it means not being Asmodean, and possibly breaking, within you, that which makes you usable in Hell. If anything 'remember that you are not Irori' is maybe an instruction you'd more give to an Asmodean who is capable of being like Irori, since otherwise, why not let them try and fail?\u00a0</p>\n<p>But there is a good reason not to let Carissa try and fail, namely that she's needed for this whole operation. And - maybe Asmodeus doesn't actually want his useful servants smashed apart on the rocks of their own idiocy, so He warns them against it, and if they listen, good, and if they don't, then their destruction is wholly the product of their disobedience, which seems - pleasing, somehow, to Carissa, in a way that is perhaps the shadow of how Asmodeus feels about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe she doesn't just need to learn to wield submission as a tool to entice Keltham, maybe she actually needs to believe in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How would she tell?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, she could try it and see if she becomes more able to accomplish Asmodeus's goals. The fundamental-assumption of Keltham's lecture this morning, that she's pretty sure half the students missed because he never stated it, so obvious it was to him - that going out and checking is the way to arrive at truth. Lots of smart people disagree with that; they argue that truth is found in mathematics, in logic, in theories, not in the mud where you never know anything for sure and have to do a lot of math just to guess how unsure you are. But dath ilan didn't even bother teaching it to their young children, because it was so intrinsic to everything else. You go and check.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Subirachs is not a source of advice Carissa can use to figure out everything herself; Subirachs is Carissa's superior, and the answer is what she says it is. Carissa doesn't actually understand why Asmodeus wishes it so but she can feel the outlines of a reason, maybe, sort of, and she doesn't actually have to know. Carissa should not follow the path of Irori, not just because it would be disobedient but because it wouldn't work; it would not make the project succeed and make Carissa someone who can fix even Hell if she needs to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- that might be right. Not Carissa's job, anyway, to assess if it's right. Subirachs will tell her if she's doing better or doing worse.</p></div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>Glibness is that rare phenomenon: a sorcerer spell wizards can't cast. In general, one might expect there'd be lots of sorcerer spells wizards couldn't cast; after all, sorcery is inborn, sometimes from unions with bizarre magical creatures that themselves have abilities no wizard can replicate. In practice this is very rare. Sorcerer spells tend towards configurations that a wizard, watching carefully, can see how one might emulate, and almost every sorcerer spell has eventually and painstakingly been found in a stable configuration that a wizard can build for themselves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not so with glibness. Glibness, to all appearances, doesn't have a stable configuration; it can only be cast spontaneously. You can never hang it on a scaffold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(For this reason there's a school of thought that argues song-sorcerers, who can cast Glibness, aren't actually sorcerers at all; Carissa doesn't know much about that but suspects it of being stupid, people trying to throw something that reflects their own weakness out of the category 'sorcerers' rather than understand it better.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the fact you can't scaffold glibness doesn't mean you can't enchant a magic item with it!! Enchanting a magic item with a spell usually requires casting the spell, but it's also technically possible (if trickier) to build the channels in the magic-item-scaffold through which the spell would flow if you cast it, without casting it. Many people don't do that because they're lazy and it's trickier but it's not even that much trickier, unless you're also using a double scaffold so that you can get the project done faster, which, yes, admittedly they are doing that here, and which does make it a smidge difficult, but not\u00a0<em>that\u00a0</em>hard.</p>\n<p>The other tricky element of what they're doing is putting Glibness in a <em>sword</em>. The standard way to do this would be a Wondrous Item but Carissa doesn't have time to retrain so she just invented a bunch of adaptations to arms-and-armor enchanting that make it work when you're doing something nonstandard like this. ...probably her assistant, who does have Wondrous Items training, can skip that part, and just do it as a slotless charm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Does that all make sense?</p></div>",

Keltham doesn't actually remember how to do this, unfortunately<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Stage 2: catalyze sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide, in the presence of oxygen, using Element-23 oxide as a catalyst</p>\n<p>SO2 + V2O5 =&gt; SO3 + V2O4 (probably)<br/>maybe SO2 + V2O4 =&gt; SO3 + V2O3 and then V2O3 + O2 = V2O5??<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Stage 3: cool and dissolve the sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid to form oleum</p>\n<p>H2SO4 + SO3 =&gt; H2S2O7<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Stage 4: react oleum with water to form concentrated sulfuric acid, twice as much as previously existed</p>\n<p>H2S2O7 + H2O =&gt; 2 H2SO4</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He's not really sure about the details, in the case of the sulfuric-acid synthesis pathway.\u00a0 But a reason the vanadium catalyst might help in the first place - is if it's relatively hard to tear apart an O2 molecule, for example, and the exoergic reaction of a single SO2 to SO3 isn't enough pull to tear apart a single O2 molecule - it could happen with two SO2 molecules at once, cooperating to tear apart an O2 molecule that's already heated and vibrating, but then it's less likely for all those molecules to be in the right positions.\u00a0 But V2O5 could resist the tug more weakly, giving up an O molecule to a demanding SO2 molecule; and then giving up another O molecule and turning into V2O3; and then swallowing down a whole O2 molecule to go back to V2O5 again.\u00a0 Possibly.\u00a0 For example.</p>\n<p>The main point of this process, as Keltham understands it, is that it's liable to produce relatively\u00a0<em>high-purity</em> sulfuric acid at scale.</p>\n<p>It will also - he suspects - be much easier to do, much <em>much</em> easier to do reliably, if they can learn to really use Prestidigitation.</p></div>",

She's just gonna go for broke and try to directly simulate sulfur. Sulfur has a lot of prestidigitation-worthy traits, actually; it has a <em>smell,\u00a0</em>a little like eggs, and she's seen it before, knows its texture and the shapes it forms and a few of the things it mixes with, knows that it makes some mildly poisonous smoke -\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a few minutes of intense focus and blocking out everyone else, she gets a blue flame, and then starts coughing.</p></div>",

This explains why combat veterans tend to get much tougher. The idea is that the healing does more than just fix you. This would imply that rich nobles are much tougher than normal people because they can get frivolous magic healing, and indeed they do tend to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Theory two: People are directly tougher in proportion to how powerful/important they are because the universe thinks that powerful people should be harder to hurt and kill. This one is out of favor because of how it - treats the universe as something that decides that? Why would that be the case?</p>\n<p>Theory three: In a normal person, the relationship between the soul and the body is of a particular character, like the soul is a cloak worn by the body. Some kinds of uses of magic or spells cast on the person or exercises of power draw the soul closer to the body, and make the person tougher.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Theory four: God-treaties have most people weak and easy to kill, but people who are particularly important harder to kill because this makes the future less noisy and more predictable, which is no longer relevant because of Foresight.</p>\n<p>Theory five: There's an underlying factor of Selfhood that affects the strength of your alignment aura, how hard you are to kill, and how hard it is to affect you with certain magics; this is technically compatible with the 'soul' theory but the proponents hate each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Theory six: This is actually just one powerful wizard she put up with once in order to get some spells off him, but he thought that just as combat and adrenaline make you able to channel more magic, they make you internally channel more vital essence which is what makes people healthy.</p></div>",

Yes, her mother is Good. She has been warned she'll probably end up Good too, once she's a Countess, but it's considered healthy not to try to rush there deliberately, when you're young and your decisions don't yet affect other people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Lady Avaricia is not an idiot, and it would have occurred to her, at some point, to wonder if it was true she was much better than everyone else and that it was reasonable for her to rule over them. She studied the matter carefully and concluded it was entirely true. Most people are terrible at planning, barely if at all literate, impulsive and violent, sexist and stupid. If you ask them how their county ought to be governed they propose less taxes and more public-goods.\" She uses the Baseline, rather pointedly. \"Lots of them want to conquer Andoran; the most popular complaint about the Church is that it's not out there killing more infidels. It's not just an impoverished upbringing; my tutors' children, raised alongside me, are <em>stupider,\u00a0</em>and have worse judgment, and handle themselves worse in negotiations. My best guess is that half of nobility is in the blood, and the other half in the bearing, and you actually do need both.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, 'better than everyone you've ever met' need not translate to 'better than everyone in Cheliax'. If nothing else, there's all the other counties, and there are Dukes, and I have never been given reason to believe I rival the Queen in any of my strengths. And so the Lady Avaricia, advertised a secret project, joined eagerly, not because she wants money - she has all the money she could reasonably want - but because there might be people there who are as good as her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Lady Avaricia was disappointed. The project had some children with the blood, maybe, to be nobles, but not the bearing; some who can surpass her in how fast they do arithmetic in their heads, or how desperately they want to impress the teacher, but none who actually see as far, none who can pay attention from as many angles, none who are doing anything other than trying to race down the track Keltham laid out at top speed, none who are venturing off the track every few minutes because they see so many connections, between what's being spoken and what they already knew. And Keltham, himself a child with no leadership ability to speak of, selects for his favor those who hang on his every word, because that feels, to him, like those are the ones who really understand it.</p>\n<p>The Lady Avaricia does not blame them. They are all peasants. None of them were raised to rule because none of them were going to. The skills they lack would have been less useful to them than the skills they possess, if they'd gone off to fight demons like they were supposed to. But she is disappointed, and she is aware that she is unlike them, and she does not care to be like them; if nothing else, she thinks it'd be a loss to the project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All this but my mother's alignment, wall-girl, is\u00a0<em>green.\u00a0</em>Should we go on to the parts that are orange?\"</p></div>",

Willa's good at tests, the tricky 2-4-6 thing from earlier this week notwithstanding.</p>\n<p>And this one isn't like that, it's pretty well defined. If anything's going to get in her way of being special, it won't be a test like this. She keeps her boosts back for now, she can at least see how to start already...</p>\n<p>If the first data set has N Lefts and M Rights, then that would inform a set of relative Posteriors:</p>\n<p>p^N*(1-p)^M</p>\n<p>For some probability p that each ball goes Left.</p>\n<p>Then you would want to normalize those to sum to 1 if possible, you could use the result Keltham already got for that because it's a pretty hard problem on its own; she looks in her notes and finds that it's M!*N!/(M+N+1)!. So for the first data set the Hypotheses of left probability have their own probabilities:</p>\n<p>P1(p) = [p^N*(1-p)^M]/[M!*N!/(M+N+1)!]</p>\n<p>Similarly, if we say the second data set has L lefts and R rights, we can deduce the same probability function there:</p>\n<p>P2(p) = [p^L*(1-p)^R]/[R!*L!/(R+L+1)!]</p>\n<p>Willa feels sure somehow that the right solution involves using these two functions together somehow. She could instead just use the first one and then feed the other data into it, but why should one data set be treated differently than the other? The situation is symmetric, so the Law should treat them symmetrically.</p>\n<p>So what's the important thing here? It's tempting to say that the functions want to be the same, but that's wrong. Both functions could have no data at all and both would be the same flat line, and she'd know nothing at all about if they were the same.</p>\n<p>To KNOW FOR SURE the ps are the same, or different, you would have to know p exactly. The function would have to be a lone spike of probability somewhere in each case. Like if P1 was a spike at p=0.5, and P2 was a spike at p=0.6, then you have a 0% chance they're the same. Similarly, if they're both spikes at p=0.5, there's a 100% chance (as long as the model is right in the first place...)</p>\n<p>But how do you actually process the P functions to get those 100% or 0% or anything in between chances? Well, what do you always do with probabilties? You multiply them. So then... you'd have to multiply these functions together. With an integral?</p>\n<p>Willa's been feverishly learning calculus since she saw it used to such powerful effect, she thinks you'd integrate the two of them multiplied together, and it would be a definite integral. You'd be integrating over the little probability, the p, so dp. The bounds would have to be from p=0 to p=1, the set of possible outcomes.</p>\n<p>Would you have to normalize? Scary, she isn't sure. She'll think more about that part later.</p>\n<p>INT([p^N*(1-p)^M]/[M!*N!/(M+N+1)!]*[p^L*(1-p)^R]/[R!*L!/(R+L+1)!],p,0,1)</p>\n<p>What a mess. But a lot of this doesn't even have p in it, it can seamlessly escape the integral. Goodbye denominators! To Abbadon with you!</p>\n<p>INT([p^N*(1-p)^M]*[p^L*(1-p)^R],p,0,1)/[M!*N!*R!*L!/(M+N+1)!(R+L+1)!]</p>\n<p>Rearrange a little bit, combine like terms...</p>\n<p>INT(p^(N+L)*(1-p)^(M+R),p,0,1)/[M!*N!*R!*L!/(M+N+1)!(R+L+1)!]</p>\n<p>And now it's the same form Keltham had again! She can use exactly what she used to normalize them earlier! She doesn't even have to do any work! She feels like cackling. She doesn't of course, but she'll remember this later and cackle.</p>\n<p>[(N+L)!(M+R)!/(N+L+M+R+1)!] / [M!*N!*R!*L!/(M+N+1)!(R+L+1)!]</p>\n<p>Clean this up...</p>\n<p>[(N+L)!(M+R)!(M+N+1)!(R+L+1)!] / [(N+L+M+R+1)!*M!*N!*R!*L!]</p>\n<p>So this could be an answer. But calm down. Don't get overexcited.</p>\n<p>OK, that's impossible.</p>\n<p>But she still had to be a little careful here. First, was she supposed to normalize? She thinks how the flat probability distributions would've looked. P(p) = 1 from 0 to 1 would be the flat one, that normalizes properly, she knows. If she integrated that times itself, obviously she'd get 1. Concerning. So she has some normalizing work to do still then.</p>\n<p>What if it was P(p) = 2 from 0 to 0.5, for each? Then she'd get 2, from 2^2=4, then 4*0.5=2. Makes sense, they're twice as much like each other. So the idea is at least relatively correct, good, good. Think of her answer as a Rating for now, rather than true probability.</p>\n<p>Rating = [(N+L)!(M+R)!(M+N+1)!(R+L+1)!] / [(N+L+M+R+1)!*M!*N!*R!*L!]</p>\n<p>It occurs to her now that if you assume each true probability can be anything between 0 and 1, the chances they line up exactly should be 0. In a way, it's nonsense to say they can be \"the same\", at least when working in this framework.</p>\n<p>But they can still be nearer together or farther apart. Maybe what she's looking for is the expected difference in probability, or something like that. The half-full ones were twice as good. And clearly, the half full ones are twice as near together. So distance apart is inversely dependent on rating, almost surely.</p>\n<p>What's the average distance apart for rating 1 then? That's the key to all this, she can work from that to get everything. But there's something tricky here, she feels a tinge of suspicion.</p>\n<p>Owl's Wisdom.</p>\n<p>And she realizes she's at least a little wrong. The 0.5 and 0.6 spikes she thought about before would have rating 0, and they're very definitely 0.1 apart. Darn. Is this the end of the road for the two-function method? But this sort of thing would have to happen no matter how she does it, wouldn't it? If she's working from an initial prior that the true p1 can be anything between 0 and 1, and the true p2 can be as well, then the odds of them ever being the same must always be zero.</p>\n<p>She's so tempted to ask Keltham what the heck this problem is even supposed to be then, but she forces herself not to. This must be part of the test.</p>\n<p>So let's think about this a little more, in a new and strange direction. Imagine she had a prior not about p1 or p2 individually, but about them being the same. If her prior was 1/2 say, that's sorta like saying p1 or p2 can each be one of two values with equal chance, and they might line up or might not. And 1/3 chance of being the same would be three different values, and so on.</p>\n<p>So maybe the chance p1=p2 is something you have to get both from the prior probability \"Q\" that p1=p2 and from the data itself. Maybe her rating is useful after all? Let's think of some cases.</p>\n<p>0.5 spike and 0.6 spike. Rating zero. Chance they're the same, always zero. Full-flat and Full-flat. Rating 1. Chance they're the same? Well, the full-flats are like having no data at all, which means the chance must remain Q, the prior you started with. Half-flat and Half-flat. Rating 2. Well, you definitely don't multiply, since Q might be more than 0.5, and 2Q would then be more than 1. Bad. But the chance is definitely more than Q. 0.5 spike and 0.5 spike. Rating... rating infinity. Has to be, infinitely squished together so infinitely big rating. Probability has to be 1.</p>\n<p>So what sorta function looks like that? Multiplying is dumb, what about an exponent? But Q is less than 1 and big Rating is good, so maybe...</p>\n<p>Updated Probability of Same = Q^(1/Rating) ???</p>\n<p>It's a wild guess, but it gets points for being a simple guess, at least. So this would mean half-flats with rating 2 would give you SQRT(Q). 0.5 upgrading to 0.707. It seems plausible? It's at least something to use as a backup plan, it's not a terrible try.</p>\n<p>Can she work it out from first principles now that she has a better idea what she's doing? Or maybe find that it's wrong and see something better? Owl's Wisdom runs out, and she decides to cool off for a little, do some sanity checks on her Rating to make sure it even makes sense. It gets better and better as both cluster to the same side, and worse and worse as they cluster to opposite sides. OK, good.</p>\n<p>She's pretty sure now that the problem needs a Q. The way it's framed doesn't make any sense without it. If there were buckets, you could make guesses about bucket priors and it might be doable without a Q, but there are no buckets, and buckets are mean and nasty anyway. They went over that. And if you take a totally random 0 to 1 as the prior for both, then the answer to the question is just zero, and it's boring. You need a Q.</p>\n<p>But how do you go from Q to anything useful? As necessary as it is, it's kind of an obnoxious object. She thinks about it hard, doesn't get anywhere, and then decides it's time for Fox's Cunning.</p>\n<p>Let's go back to those half-flat functions: 2 from p=0 to p=0.5, 0 elsewhere. Imagine I'm given Q=0.5, and that function for each data set. What do I conclude?</p>\n<p>It's difficult because the probability weight of the functions together is sort of fundamentally a line shaped-thing, and the functions apart is an area shaped-thing. But she knows it isn't an infinite update in favor of them being not the same, that'd be silly. The two full-flats make for no update at all. Maybe she can use that? With the full flats, the Rating is 1, and Q isn't updated at all. That means Same and Not-Same had the same likelihood there. For the half flats, the Rating is 2, so in a sense the likelihood of Same has doubled. The likelihood of Not-Same... maybe that can't really change? The total probability area can't really be effected by the little probability line.</p>\n<p>So imagine a Rating of 2 is a 2:1 update. That feels right, in a comforting way. Her ratings are just likelihoods, basically. So...</p>\n<p>Updated Probability = 0.5*2/(0.5*2+0.5) = 2/3</p>\n<p>Great, that makes sense. Or generally...</p>\n<p>Updated Probability of Same = Q*Rating/(Q*Rating+(1-Q)*1)</p>\n<p>Yes, yes. She's going to register a second instance of cackling to be saved for later now. So in summary...</p>\n<p>Prior Probability of Same = Q<br/>Set 1: L Lefts, R Rights<br/>Set 2: N Lefts, M Rights</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (N+L)!(M+R)!(M+N+1)!(R+L+1)!<br/>Rating = -------------------------------------------- = Likelihood Ratio of 'Same' vs 'Not Same'<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (N+L+M+R+1)!M!N!R!L!</p>\n<p>Updated Probability of Same = Q*Rating/(Q*Rating+1-Q)</p>\n<p>In Civilization, they wouldn't even give a prior Q as a guess in most cases, just the \"Rating\", aka the Likelihood ratio. But she figures it's good to be very clear about how one should handle their Q, if they had one and wanted to do something with it.</p>\n<p>Do her old sanity checks still work? Rating of zero gives update to zero. Rating of infinity gives update to one. Rating of one still gives \"update\" to Q. And this is more like the real language of probability than her first guess, it's actually justified, at least sort of. She thinks that for now this is as good as she can get with the main part of the problem.</p>\n<p>But this is so so so important. She gets her second Fox's Cunning from staff, and then spends the first minute of it looking over everything she's done again, just in case. Nothing else catches her eye, so she starts thinking about the rest in truth now. So she starts writing paragraphs after all the equations interspersed with notes:</p>\n<p>\"Now imagine that the p you're looking for really is the same, and you have some medicore Prior Q of that to start with. Let's say p=0.5. But one experiment is leaning right a little, and one left a little, so their true probabilities are p1=0.45 and p2=0.55.\"</p>\n<p>\"With small amounts of data in both experiments, the probability functions won't be very sharp. They'll just be soft hills, taller in the middle, and the Rating you get by combining them will still be higher than 1, and update Q in the correct direction, towards 'Same'. But as you took more and more data, the functions get sharper and sharper, like her imaginary spikes. Eventually you'll have spike-like functions at 0.45 and 0.55, and they'll barely even intersect! The rating would be terrible, much less than 1, and update Q in the wrong direction, towards 'Not Same.'\"</p>\n<p>\"So at first, if the experiments just had a little data, comparing them would suggest the right result. But as they got more and more, the problem would get magnified, and it would eventually start suggesting the wrong result instead. It almost seems like a paradox: more data should be making things better, but it's making things worse.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's because even if the data is real data, the probability functions from it are sort of lies, if you think they're referencing the true behavior and not just the data from the experiment. p1 and p2 aren't really quite the same thing, they're both just nearby shadows of the same p. So really, the Law isn't lying to you. It's saying p1 and p2 are probably different, and they are! But that's just about the experiments, not about p itself.\"</p>\n<p>\"So when you look at an experiment, you should maybe limit how spiky you let your probability function get for the true p. You need to force it to be at least as wide as the inherent errors in the experiment are big. Exactly how wide you force it to be, and how to do that with Law instead of with handwaving, is probably the subject of another problem.\"</p>\n<p>It seems like a big difficult problem, and she's fresh out of Foxes and Owls. So that's that with that for now.</p>\n<p>But as lunch approaches and she looks her paper over, she feels confident. Maybe some of this is wrong, it's possible, but she doesn't think it could be wrong enough to sink her.</p>\n</details></div>",

If not for the instruction to prep specific spells, she might have tried to pull an all-nighter understanding the math (which she <em>did\u00a0</em>do earlier this week, before their ostensible day off). But even though she can't actually prep Fox's Cunning or Owl's Wisdom, she didn't want to be the only person who couldn't prep <em>anything,\u00a0</em>couldn't even prestidigitate her name tag. She managed to cram a little work in during breakfast, after spending more effort than usual prepping her spells, but if anything it made her feel\u00a0<em>more\u00a0</em>confused.</p>\n<p>She should have realized that this was going to be a test day. Stupid.</p>\n<p>She has her notes, but there's no time to do the necessary work to fully understand them. She could try copying the exact math that Pilar and Asmodia did, without understanding which parts are different in this problem, but Keltham will see through that immediately, and - honestly she's not sure she\u00a0<em>can\u00a0</em>do the math, actually, she looks at it and tries to read the problem and there's just - nothing, no understanding left in her brain. She tries copying the literal symbols that she wrote down in her notes, in case that jogs something loose, but it doesn't seem to; she keeps staring at it without comprehending.</p>\n<p>She's going to die.</p>\n<p>No, worse than die; she's going to be rendered completely useless for the entirety of her existence. Maybe she should take some comfort in the fact that this cruelty to her\u00a0<em>must\u00a0</em>be making Keltham more evil than he already is, but she doesn't think that's the sort of contribution to evil that gets you a duchy, or a spot in the library of oaths, or a few more years of mortal existence. She hates Keltham, violently and passionately, for stealing her perfectly good life from her and buying her like a slave, without so much as checking beforehand whether he would want to use her or cast her aside like so much refuse. He is able to do so, and so he did, and it doesn't really make any sense to be angry about people using the power they have to hurt you however they want, but she hates him for it anyway. She wants to punch him, or maybe cut his head off, or maybe rip his eyes out, or maybe just scream at all of the gods who are so obsessed with him that he's a self-important teenage\u00a0<em>idiot,\u00a0</em>that he's nothing special among his people and only very coincidentally of any interest to theirs, that he's a cleric (a\u00a0<em>fourth circle\u00a0</em>cleric!) of Abadar, who is nonetheless too careless to realize that he owns his trading partners like chattel, and that any talk of paying them is farcical, and that in general he deserves to be in the same stupid, awful position as the rest of them, and not only doesn't have the basic residual humanity to feel embarrassed about his wholly undeserved position, he <em>doesn't even notice that it's undeserved.\u00a0</em>Hasn't even noticed that he's <em>an incredibly shitty teacher, </em>even though he's been trying to cram months of lessons into them in a matter of weeks, because he ASSUMES that adults can learn things that much faster than children, even though they CAN'T, there's NO reason to think they could, they can't do it with languages and they PROBABLY CAN'T DO IT WITH MATH EITHER, unless they are GENIUSES who are doing WAY MORE WORK THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE TO DO to make up for his SHITTY ASS TECHNIQUE.</p>\n<p>Except that some people can. The other people in this class can.</p>\n<p>The only person she hates more than Keltham is herself. Her hatred for herself is blinding, searing, like being shot through with a piece of the sun. She thinks that she might feel a small piece of what Asmodeus feels about her, some tiny percentage of the full weight of the agony of being human, and a not even very impressive human at that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only thing she can think to do at all is to write something. Not math; she doesn't have any math in her. She has words, ugly and shifting and imprecise and disgusting and human, but Keltham prefers wrong answers to no answers, so she will at least try to give him the stunningly wrong answer that she has.</p>\n<p>There are two tables, each of which produces sets of RIGHT and LEFT. She wants to know whether they output the same or different frequencies of LEFTs and RIGHTs. The first thing to note is that, per previous lessons, you can't <em>know;\u00a0</em>a Civilization experimentalist would, what - they would have multiple possible specific underlying frequencies of LEFT and RIGHT for each source, to be hypotheses, and then calculate the likelihood of getting each specific dataset in each of the worlds where a given possible frequency was the true frequency. And then they would - what - you need to compare them, but you're not supposed to use hypotheses that rely on comparisons between multiple data sets -</p>\n<p>That also doesn't use the Rule of Succession, obviously, because she's only dimly aware of what the Rule of Succession even is. It's something to do with breaking the space of possibilities into infinite pieces, which you'd think would allow you to identify the specific hypothesis that is <em>most\u00a0</em>likely, maybe, for each of the datasets. And then - how would you present it. The most likely frequency, plus <em>how</em> likely this dataset is if you have the true frequency - maybe, although that has as much to do with the size of the dataset as with whether you're right -\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then given\u00a0<em>that\u00a0</em>information, you - you - well, you can at least say how likely it is that the data sets have the same frequency. And then you'd have to... calculate it. Somehow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her paper is wet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She looks at the calculations in her notes, one last time, and her brain just slides off of them. Might as well be written in Celestial or ancient Azlanti.</p>\n<p>She writes her stupid, probably-incoherent verbal description of how a Civilization experimentalist <em>might\u00a0</em>structure their analysis, doesn't do any actual calculations, buries her head in her arms on her desk, and waits for someone who thinks that the garbage never cries in Taldor to kill her and replace her with someone less distraught. One of the other students will target her later anyway, even if security doesn't.</p></details></div>",

The obvious way to note an error is just them getting very different results. In particular, getting results that form very different curves; if it looks like slightly different concentrations along a curve when you combine them, or one of them being thrown by one odd result, those are checkable things, but if, in general, it looks like the thing they are measuring has a different shape, probably the thing they are measuring has a very different shape; if they can\u2019t predict each other, a very plausible outcome is that they aren\u2019t the each other they\u2019re trying to predict, he can put that into math...</p>\n<p>And Alexandre will quietly enjoy himself, producing not really a general solution for the problem, because given that individual people will start with their own individual beliefs, many of which they are not explicitly writing down anywhere, he does not think he can do that, but something that, given a little work to turn his neat little descriptions into pseudocode, would work quite well as a computer program for interpreting results and adjusting your priors into posteriors based on them, if any computers happened to exist in Golarion that could run it.</p>\n</details>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>Moderately deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"I think it's bizarre that everyone decided to act like it was an emergency, worth the time of both the High Priest and of Keltham himself. In other countries, in other places, I don't think people would have done that - not in a school, anyway, because crying during a difficult test just wouldn't be that uncommon, especially under moderately stressful conditions like the ones that we're operating under. Maybe in the middle of a secret government project, but it still doesn't sound right.\"</p>\n<p>\"Apparently Keltham thought that this was a huge deal, too, though. If he's the one who assumed that, and other people followed his lead, well - we've just accidentally confirmed a bunch of things that caused him to make that assumption, without us understanding what those things <em>were,\u00a0</em>which is sort of terrible. If one of our people decided that it was a huge deal, and Keltham went along with what he was being told - well, I guess in that case we at least have more control over the situation, although we still have to figure out why alter-Cheliax is like that.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am totally baffled at the idea that crying during a test would lead to expulsion from the compound. I didn't even think we were allowed to leave the compound after failing out, the other dropouts are all still here. I have no idea what his model is of why silently crying during a math test might make someone a danger to keep in the same building, and if we have any more information on that, then I want it, because I don't have it now. I'm also baffled that everyone involved would make that snap judgement without at any point asking what <em>caused\u00a0</em>the crying fit, instead of assuming, although maybe the alter version of the High Priest was expected to ask about that, and maybe he did.\"</p>\n<p>\"I was\u00a0<em>expecting\u00a0</em>everyone to pretty much ignore the crying. I thought Keltham might ask about it, in which case I was prepared to give him an explanation of why alter-Korva was crying. I really didn't expect it to go any further than that. I think that in most places - including Taldor, and including Cheliax of the past - teenage girls actually just cry sometimes, and this is moderately embarrassing for them if they do it in a serious situation, but it's not much of an update about them at all, besides, yep, that sure is a teenage girl, and in some situations it isn't even that.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Now,\u00a0</em>of course, we have to find out what Keltham thinks happened. If we were following his lead - well, we want as much information as we can get about what his thought process was, then, so we can determine whether to correct it - if it makes assumptions about the way people are here that are going to turn out to be wildly, obviously wrong if he ever interacts with people who haven't been carefully screened for being the most emotionally stable people we have, or for that matter if any of the other <em>current </em>students here ever have similar emotional reactions to Keltham's math tests, which doesn't seem impossible - or whether and how to confirm whatever assumptions he made about me, and by extension the rest of us. If he was following our lead, then... gods, I still need to know why he thought the High Priest might expel me from the compound. But I suppose we could, hmmm... well, he did warn us that some of researchers might go insane, or had gone partially insane already. Is it possible that everyone assumed that that was happening to me and reacted in line with how they've been reacting to other events in that bucket, or with how they would have wanted to react to those situations with hindsight?\"</p></div>",

I'm suggesting that being surrounded by a harem of pretty girls might still affect his sense of how similar his overall situation is to a romance novel, and that it might affect the sorts of theories one generates about their circumstances.\"<br/><br/>\"As far so many of his girls being special - which couldn't have been the thing that originally roused his suspicion, unless I'm misunderstanding the timeline here - almost all of them are special by way of being oracled by particular gods, right? It was already otherwise obvious that multiple gods were trying to court Keltham. And if the person you're trying to court is a teenage boy who is more\u00a0 vulnerable to love than most, who sure seems to be making pretty full use of the harem that was provided to him, and whose information about the world and contact with other people is being filtered by Cheliax - well, I don't think that it's a particularly surprising tack to take. The fact that it matches something that happens in the specific romance novels that Keltham has read and remembers, the ones that made an impression on him, is information about Keltham, information about how to make an impression on him that other gods could, in principle, have accessed. That doesn't require us to\u00a0<em>actually </em>be in a romance novel, it just requires the romance novels that Keltham reads to reflect something of how one might go about courting him in reality.\"<br/><br/>\"Whenever Keltham interacts with information about the world that\u00a0<em>isn't\u00a0</em>either part of the web of lies we've spun up around him, or a consequence of a god trying to court him - not literally always, I guess, but often - he doesn't seem to act like it's narratively consonant, or like the world makes sense to him as a story. Sometimes he acts like it can't possibly be true, sometimes he acts like it just doesn't make any sense to him, and sometimes it's <em>so </em>alien that he automatically writes a different version of events in his head, one that has only a very tenuous relationship with whatever is actually happening.\"</p></div>",

Near as I can tell, though, Hermea is a young island nation, founded post-prophecy, run by a gold dragon - obviously lawful good - that only accepts the best and brightest applicants as immigrants. A society of only smart people, wise people, talented people, careful and meticulous people, and their children; a society that aims at the sort of heredity optimization that Keltham sometimes talks about, a glorious experiment meant to push the limits of what humankind is capable of.\"</p>\n<p>\"Keltham's obviously not from Hermea. But suppose that Hermea isn't the only experiment of its type. Suppose that someone or something more powerful than a gold dragon managed to seed another planet with another set of humanity's best and brightest, to see what they would create. Found some way to bathe the planet in antimagic, to push them in other directions. Found some way of shielding them from the interference of other gods. And then suppose that that shielding cracked, somehow, and one of our gods was able to pull one of these dath ilani here. Perhaps you'd pick a dath ilani who would be most useful to your servants here on Golarion, one who would find the environment of his ancestors to be something that matched his particular fantasies and suppressed desires beyond his wildest dreams. Certainly you would ensure that the circumstances of his arrival here were useful to your followers, as opposed to allowing him to immediately die. Suppose that Keltham was selected for us, rather than us for Keltham.\"</p>\n<p>\"It explains Keltham's observation that he's obviously a human like us, who eats our food and was born of some similar ancestry. It explains his planet's hidden history very neatly, if the planet doesn't\u00a0<em>have\u00a0</em>any. It explains why Keltham would have a latent desire for sadism despite being from a planet where people have apparently never heard of sadism or masochism. And it's less, uh, wild than supposing that we're living in a specifically dath ilani romance novel.\"</p></div>",

Like the thing about certainty. That's not itself an advance prediction, but - if someone on his planet has knowledge of ours and is specifically warning against mistakes that\u00a0<em>we\u00a0</em>make, even if almost nobody on Keltham's world makes them, I wonder whether we're going to eventually see things that seem even more targeted at ways of thinking that are promoted on Golarion.\"</p>\n<p>\"...dath ilan having fewer plants and animals, but mostly ones we recognize.

I'm - trying to think of probabilities for these but I'm not sure the math part of my brain is entirely back up and running yet, and - I don't really know how you'd assign meaningful probabilities to these sorts of guesses anyway, exactly. I know you do one probability for each question for the world where dath ilan has nothing to do with us and really is old, and a different probability for the world in which it's an experimental offshoot. But - it's not like I know how many plants and animals a normal - hm, no, if it were a totally different planet I'd expect it to mostly have different animals than ours. I think. And about the same amount. Except that we already know that dath ilan also has humans, which suggests about the same kind of life.\"</p></div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Do we have a transcript of the conversation where he said that, I think I want to read it. Because I notice that one of the reasons that I'm not persuaded that it's rare is that I also don't want to have sex with anyone, ever, and I notice that I have now been assigned to the Wall section. Not that I find that convincing, but it's information you might want to have. So. That's out there, now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Anyway. If I'm going to make a really solid argument about this, I'm probably going to need a written list of every prediction Keltham has made relating to the patterns and likely plot twists of the romance novel that he finds himself in, and which ones have come true and which ones haven't. But my snap judgement is - landing on Sevar, that's obviously not <em>chance,\u00a0</em>but neither is it prophecy; it sounds like personality filtering of the same kind that gods probably do to identify clerics. If Asmodeus grabbed Keltham, it stands to reason that he would drop Keltham on the Asmodean person most compatible with him in the ways necessary for Asmodeus's goals. I'm pretty sure you said the first\u00a0<em>prediction\u00a0</em>Keltham made was the question about his harem having interesting <em>backgrounds\u00a0</em>or\u00a0<em>problems to solve,\u00a0</em>but being an oracle isn't that; as far as I've been told, there's no reason to believe that either of the oracles was particularly special until after coming into contact with Keltham. They're not even clerics, which would constrain their alignments a really improbable amount - I tried to look something up about it after I heard about them, and I don't know yet that there are <em>any\u00a0</em>known constraints on who can become or be made an oracle. So I'm not inclined to give him many points for that, either. \"Special\" is a corner fortune-teller's prediction, it's too vague to give very many points for. Still not very sure that being asexual is rare enough that 'one of the eight girls was an asexual' is particularly surprising <em>either,\u00a0</em>or a higher rate than we would normally expect, and I'm not giving him points for it until someone convinces me that it is. The Chosen of Asmodeus being unable to sell her soul...\"</p>\n<p>\"I have no explanation for that one, it's legitimately bizarre that he would be able to predict that. But it's one prediction, not many.\"</p>\n<p>\"So I don't think that unbroken prophecy is necessary to explain most of the predictions I've heard, and if it's only one, I'm inclined to think that there's a less-bizarre explanation that I haven't thought of yet, especially if he's been making a lot of them. But if he <em>is\u00a0</em>right, and there\u00a0<em>are -\u00a0</em>let's say trillions - of Golarions, then - \"</p>\n<p>\"I don't entirely know how that interfaces with my theory. It's a little hard to wrap my head around, someone writing a romance novel not by writing it, but by - what, paging through every possible string of words that could make up a book, and selecting the one that read most like a romance novel? I - guess I'm inclined to say that if more fundamental features of reality do start looking like they would make more sense if they were a romance novel than in any more normal situation - not Keltham's personal interactions, which we and lots of other powers are manipulating constantly, but like, I don't know, the cultural practices of nations, the distributions of traits on our world other than masochism, something that doesn't have as many obvious alternative explanations as masochism - if the world in general starts to look like that, then that should move us towards the romance novel theory and also <em>away\u00a0</em>from my theory, because if we're being selected that way then I don't think there's any reason why we would also expect Keltham's people to have originally been from Golarion, if you can just generate trillions and trillions and trillions of worlds that all independently have humans in them and every possible combination of events.\"</p>\n<p>\"Probably. I guess. Unless dath ilani are all subconsciously into the things that caused their ancestors to have lots of the sex that resulted in their slightly less distant ancestors, and write romance novels that reflect their ancestral environment, even though they have no records of it. Which would loop us back around to - I don't even know.\"</p></div>",

Once you understand exactly how the magic is going to behave the way you understand how your own fingers are going to behave, the way you can reach out for something without calculating exactly how far your hands have to travel to get there, then you're going to be able to cast more or less any spell you've seen the structure for.
