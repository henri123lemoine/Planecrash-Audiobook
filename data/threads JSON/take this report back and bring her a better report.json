            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>Lean. Yes your Majesty. okay. Carissa feels fragile and like she needs the Queen of Cheliax personally petting her hair to be okay, and that's just how she feels and she's going to do nothing about it, not a terrifying vulnerability at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Carissa feels happy. It's a distant kind of happy, it's not the happiness she is used to feeling, but - it was a beautiful story with a happy ending, and she was impressive and valuable and Abrogail had a good time. also she can apparently use spellsilver at a distance of six or eight feet. and she's fourth circle. that's a lot to be happy about, really.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Carissa feels - overawed. The sense of being in something greater than herself. It's a good sense. It's where a lot of her loyalty is located, to Asmodeus and to Cheliax, the sincere conviction that the people in charge are better than her. Abrogail is a great Queen. She doesn't just think this because Abrogail staged an incredibly elaborate torture-execution and then petted her hair. That wouldn't be a good reason to think it. She thinks it because she's - starting to get a fraction of a sense of how hard it really is, to do things, and Abrogail does lots of things.</p>\n<p>Her complaints while she was dying and yelling at Abrogail were totally true, though. Except the ones inapplicable because Security's bizarre incompetence was to reduce the pressure on Keltham-actor or whatever. But notably they weren't complaints about actual decisions Abrogail has actually made. Because those have been good. Including the decision to rent Carissa, which has paid some serious corrupting-Keltham dividends and also been good for the both of them. Abrogail's advisors who were opposed to this were unreasonable, and that's only a tiny bit protectiveness of Maillol which Carissa now feels because he's one of the tools she'll need for her project and people made him\u00a0<em>worse\u00a0</em>at it. Unlike this. This made Carissa better. This was a gift to Carissa, not an indulgence at her expense, and Carissa is so grateful, and so - assured, very deeply, in her faith.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contessa Lrilatha is what Carissa wants to grow up to be in the long run but Abrogail might be what she wants to grow up to be in the shorter term while she's actually alive. Not in the sense where she wants to be Queen of Cheliax. She doesn't. She's really actually honestly loyal and if it ever comes up again that she is tempted to flee because she failed so badly, she'll instead turn herself in, because it's how Evil dath ilan would set up the incentives and it's also how Abrogail has, because she's wonderful.</p></div>",

She's very forgiving.\"</p>\n<p><br/>Which Carissa is slightly jealous of. Carissa is actually only moderately into pain and her life would really be easier if she just loved it. But no, she's pretty sure what she has is a moderate amount of being\u00a0<em>into\u00a0</em>pain, a very high\u00a0<em>pain tolerance, </em>an enjoyment of being pushed to her inconveniently far limits, and a strong desire to be in the power of someone who deserves to have power over her, and that's not actually a very convenient sexuality unless you happen to tempt the Queen of Cheliax with - what did she even tempt the Queen of Cheliax with. Not her personality, it apparently needed a thorough makeover. Maybe the Queen sees the same appeal in dath ilani people that Carissa does but Carissa doesn't have much of it, yet.</p></div>",
