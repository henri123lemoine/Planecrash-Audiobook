It didn't happen naturally when Tallandria tried it, nor when she attempted obvious blind manipulations of 'potential energy surfaces'.\u00a0 Tallandria remembers, and transcripts agree, that Keltham at INT 18 said he couldn't think of any simple way to find crystal structures without advanced technology out of Civilization, specifically generators for ultra-tiny light particles and very fine detectors for those.\"</p></div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"post-content\"><p>Let's take this moment in time to talk (as one often does) about the theory and practice of counterassassination security in Cheliax.</p>\n<p>In Golarion generally, the vast majority of heads-of-state are defended primarily by custom, by inertia, by the country's sovereign not actually being important enough to be worth defending against the equivalent of one person with a distance-targetable projectile weapon.\u00a0 Security-through-nobody-actually-bothering-to-attack-you-all-that-hard-or-creatively is the most popular kind of security.</p>\n<p>The Queen of Cheliax, Abrogail Thrune II, is one of the rare\u00a0<em>exceptions</em> to this rule.\u00a0 From the standpoint of, say, the Church of Iomedae, Abrogail Thrune makes Golarion significantly worse just by existing, and if she stopped ruling Cheliax her replacement would probably\u00a0<em>not</em> be equally creative and dynamic.\u00a0 Iomedae's Church would pay a\u00a0<em>lot</em> of money to any creative person who managed to kill Abrogail Thrune in a way where she didn't come back; or, better yet, to anyone who could take the Crown of Infernal Majesty permanently off the board.</p>\n<p>So Abrogail Thrune's personal security model centers around the presumption that the attacker's primary goals, and the primary negative outcomes that Cheliax wants to avoid, are:<br/><br/>1)\u00a0 Somebody taking Abrogail Thrune down in a way that True Resurrection, or at ultimate need Miracles and Wishes, cannot fix.\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/soul-bind/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Soul Bind</a>, most obviously, and then getting away with the soul-gem.\u00a0 Just having a daemon-worshipper Maledict her to Abaddon would not suffice; if you are willing to pay <em>enough</em> you can Wish back a Maledicted soul.\u00a0 If the body was destroyed, you can Wish up another body first.\u00a0 You'd need to do that before her soul was eaten, but unless you are really dawdling about this there will likely be time.\u00a0 Similarly, to have a daemon consume Abrogail Thrune in the process <em>of</em> an assassination would require quite a lot of time during which Cheliax had not caught up with you.\u00a0 Still, it wouldn't do to let Abrogail Thrune - or her soul gem - get Teleported onto the front doorstep of the House of Oblivion.</p>\n<p>2)\u00a0 Getting the Crown of Infernal Majesty permanently out of Cheliax's reach, presumably out of the reach of Hell and Asmodeus.\u00a0 This isn't going to be easy; Asmodeus can <em>definitely</em> see the Crown wherever it goes.\u00a0 Putting the Crown into a bag of holding and tossing the bag into a portable hole, which usually suffices to lose a thing forever in the far distant Astral Plane, is not nearly going to suffice here.\u00a0 But if you can get the Crown to Heaven - that might do it.\u00a0 Even if Asmodeus could pay Heaven to get it back, the payment would be huge enough that the injury to Evil would be vast; paladins would offer their souls for it; and in the aftermath Abrogail Thrune would no longer be Queen, or much of anything at all.</p>\n<p>All of this points to a security model that centers on keeping Abrogail Thrune <em>where she is</em> rather than\u00a0<em>alive.</em>\u00a0 The Queen is not without her defenses, over and above the crazy levels of protection from the Crown of Infernal Majesty; but this is because while the Queen is alive she can better stay in one place, and defend her Crown and her soul.\u00a0 Defending the Queen's <em>life</em> isn't the point the same way.\u00a0 That's a Raise Dead issue, or at worst a True Resurrection, or at real worst a matter of Wish and Miracle.\u00a0 So long as she's not inside a gemstone.</p></div>",
