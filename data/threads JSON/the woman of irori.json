Regrettably that is not in Cheliax's interests at this time.</p>\n<p>Cheliax's interests at this time are in preparing for war. For researchers, that means discussing with each other the merits and demerits of various plans for war, betting on them, and then doing your jobs and seeing who wins the bets. For everyone else, that means enabling the researchers in conducting their research without inconveniences of any kind. If you are directed by one researcher to inconvenience another researcher, you will not do that. You will, instead,\u00a0<em>tell me</em>, and I will\u00a0<em>personally ensure </em>that research goes uninterrupted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You may be thinking, 'probably it is wiser not to go to Carissa Sevar in a remotely ambiguous case, because coming to the attention of powerful people is generally bad'. You should, of course, notice that I ordered it, and then obey, even if obeying is bad for you, because supposedly there are <em>some Asmodeans here;</em> but there are also a lot of very muddled people here, so I will say it more clearly. If you come into my office and say 'I am concerned that I was ambiguously ordered to inconvenience a researcher', and then recite a perfectly innocuous conversation, I will tell you I appreciate your time and send you on my way.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br/>If there are\u00a0<em>problems,\u00a0</em>and I learn you knew about them and didn't say anything, then you will die in pain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I intend to instruct some of the researchers and Security here to, with my permission, give out orders to inconvenience researchers. This is a test. You pass it by coming to me; you fail it not only by doing as ordered but also by not reporting it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That is how we will handle any issues of researchers being inconvenienced, going forwards. Are there questions.\"</p></div>",

The first is that if you don't have petty dramas, then my time will be wasted only my the occasional mistake, and not very much of it. The second is that I am, in fact, in the market for a person who is capable of\u00a0<em>predicting, having heard various petty dramas, whether I'd have wanted to hear about them.\u00a0</em>You will sit in the corner of my office, write down your guesses, and then we'll see if you were good at guessing. This position is available to everyone who isn't a top-tier researcher; you have better things to do. The major job perk is that you'll be very valuable to me and I will not want to go through the hassle of finding another one. If you are interested, you may find me in my office after 2am; I expect to be busy until then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Next! I notice this project has something of a<em> leaks </em>problem; Osirion knew far too much about it, and still does, and there are some fascinating rumors spreading in Egorian. The same policy applies for this as for inconveniences to my researchers: if you learn something, even if you're not sure if it's something, <em>tell me. </em>Eventually you will tell my predictor-secretary, once I've trained one. You will not be punished for wasting my time. You will die in agony if you knew something and decided not to mention it to anyone. Fake attempts to recruit you for espionage, or just to get you to share juicy rumors, will be made.\"</p></div>",

It's not the right tool for every situation, but it's the right tool for when it's very very important to figure out what's happening around you when you don't have knockdown arguments, just uncertainties that add up either to less or more uncertainty than they began with.</p>\n<p><br/>The seventh-circle wizard on staff is almost certainly there to mindread her and make sure she isn't about to defect. A seventh-circle wizard can read her frequently, if it's their only job; maybe a quarter of the time. So she could go around with a presumption on 3:1 odds against being mindread at any given moment.</p>\n<p>However, a seventh-circle wizard specialized in divinations should be able to mindread her <em>without her noticing</em> only about 2/3rds of the time. She felt it once, while she was interrogating Maillol. That breaks down into some chance that it was a lie that he's seventh-circle, that the wizard is much more powerful than that, or that they're a seventh circle wizard with an uncanny knack for subtle spells.\u00a0 Or that they weren't, in fact, following her around mindreading her all the time, and did it a few times at particularly key moments, probably 3 or 4 times, listened for half an hour on each occasion, and was satisfied.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She can feel part of her flinching away from this calculation. What's up with that. Oh, it's that that part of her feels that thinking is only allowed if she is ABSOLUTELY SURE she is not being mindread, and that no numbers that come out of a process like this will be ABSOLUTE SURETY so they may as well stop now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, she can do the math and then decide not to scale the wall, but - but there's kind of a lot at stake, right, there's whatever Cayden Cailean is playing at and whatever Keltham is playing at and whatever Asmodia is playing at and a very real possibility, she hasn't thought about numbers, that Cheliax is going to be annihilated, and, if she won't risk anything to scale the wall, then she's risking missing whatever's on the other side - things you don't think about can still destroy you - so she has to keep trying -<br/><br/><br/>Before the observation, with Keltham in her head saying that only Keepers can say 'before the observation' and mean it, how likely would she have considered it, that this wizard had some kind of secret technique for reading people without being noticed -</p>\n<p>- vanishingly unlikely because if Cheliax had that capability they would have\u00a0<em>used it on Keltham instead of dragging the Queen and the Most High here personally.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>How likely would she have considered it that the wizard had only mindread her three or four times, for the fifteen to thirty minutes a caster of their level can do?</p>\n<p>Reasonably probable, if they didn't have instructions to do nothing at all but mindread her. Three or four times a day is a <em>lot\u00a0</em>of mindreading, by the standard of any non-Project-Lawful project she's ever heard of, and it must have crossed the wizard's mind that Carissa Sevar might get annoyed with them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And besides, she was doing so well. She was so Asmodean.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(There are definitely feelings, on the other side of the wall, about that.)</p>\n<p>Call it 20:1 in favor of 'I can notice them the approximately predictable amount' over 'they're stealthy and I can almost never notice them'.</p>\n<p>Is the stealthy version of this wizard who has instructions to read her as much as possible mindreading her now? Even that wizard can't actually get 24 hour coverage, and might choose to sleep themself, and prepare spells, while Carissa Sevar is in bed tossing and turning and being boring. In fact she probably seriously inconvenienced that wizard, what with not sleeping last night. Maybe 2:1 against, for the worst case scenario wizard. Nearly all the chance she's being mindread comes from the worst case scenario wizard; the wizard who mindread her approximately four times yesterday is something like 20:1 not reading her having boring insomnia in the dead of night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>- no, actually, wait - could they have started mindreading her when they cast the Owl's Wisdom?</p>\n<p>Only if someone saw it; and she's unscryable by strategic necessity and Alarmed her surroundings and is (10:1, maybe?) alone in the room; she can see invisible people, unless they went to some considerable lengths, her Alarm would ping unless they went to even more considerable ones, and she doesn't think any Security other than the seventh circle assigned to Carissa-observation would have the nerve, tonight, to creep into Carissa Sevar's bedroom around her Alarm.</p>\n<p>They probably would mindread her, though, if they did notice that; she has a higher chance, more like 50%, of noticing them with Owl's Wisdom up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So two possibilities point towards the most worlds where she's currently being mindread: wizard with special skill at being sneaky and reading her near continously, which she pegged at a fortieth of worlds, and normal wizard who just got alerted she cast Owl's Wisdom, which is about a twentieth of worlds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The math isn't the answer, Keltham says, but it focuses your attention. But her gut agrees with the math. It's unlikely. It is not vanishingly unlikely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Is that good enough?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Owl's Wisdom only lasts eight minutes. She thinks fast, with the headband on, much faster than other people; she can read books faster, hang spells faster, follow lines of speculation through her head faster. But eight minutes isn't very long, really, if you might possibly have a vey big problem on your hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She's lost fully one of them already to not understanding herself, and then one of them to calculating whether she's being mindread; six to go. There is no point in wasting some of them on agonizing over a decision; she may as well make it right this second.\u00a0 Say there are twenty Carissae sitting in twenty rooms; how should they choose so the most of them survive not just this decision but the war that is about to come?</p>\n<p>She is, actually, with a vague lurching sense this is risking more than she's ever risked, willing to condemn one Carissa so all the other ones can scale that wall.\u00a0</p></div>",

eg, something that explicitly represents and maximizes your true utility function is a sign flip or successful blackmail operation away from inducing its minimization.</p>\n<p>- <em>Domaining</em>. \u00a0The Thing should only figure out what it needs to know to understand its task, and ideally, should try to think about separate epistemic domains separately. \u00a0Most of its searches should be conducted inside a particular domain, not across all domains. \u00a0</p>\n</details><details>\n<summary>Corrigibility at some small length.</summary>\n<p>- <em>Unpersonhood</em>.\u00a0 The Thing shall not have qualia - not because those are unsafe, but because it's <em>morally wrong</em> given the rest of the premise, and so this postulate serves a foundation for everything that follows.</p>\n<p>- <em>Taskishness</em>.\u00a0 The Thing must be aimed at some task that is bounded in space, time, and in the knowledge and effort needed to accomplish it.\u00a0 You don't give a Limited Creation an unlimited task; if you tell an animated broom to \"fill a cauldron\" and don't think to specify how long it needs to stay full or that a 99.9% probability of it being full is just as good as 99.99%, you've got only yourself to blame for the flooded workshop.<br/>-- This principle applies fractally at all levels of <em>cognitive subtasks;</em> a taskish Thing has no 'while' loops, only 'for' loops.\u00a0 It never tries to enumerate all members of a category, only 10 members; never tries to think\u00a0<em>until</em> it finds a strategy to accomplish something, only that or five minutes whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>- <em>Mild optimization</em>.\u00a0 No part of the Thing ever looks for the <em>best </em>solution to any problem whose model was learned, that wasn't in a small formal space known at compile time, not even if it's a solution bounded in space and time and sought using a bounded amount of effort; it only ever seeks adequate solutions and stops looking once it has one.\u00a0 If you search really hard for a solution you'll end up shoved into some maximal corner of the solution space, and setting that point to extremes will incidentally set a bunch of correlated qualities to extremes, and extreme forces and extreme conditions are more likely to break something else.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<em>Tightly bounded ranges of utility and log-probability.</em>\u00a0 The system's utilities should range from 0 to 1, and its actual operation should cover most of this range.\u00a0 The system's partition-probabilities worth considering should be bounded below, at 0.0001%, say.\u00a0 If you ask the system about the negative effects of Ackermann(5) people getting dust specks in their eyes, it shouldn't consider that as much worse than most other bad things it tries to avoid.\u00a0 When it calculates a probability of something that weird, it should, once the probability goes below 0.0001% but its expected utility still seems worth worrying about and factoring into a solution, throw an exception.\u00a0 If the Thing can't find a solution of adequate expected utility without factoring in extremely improbable events, even by way of supposedly averting them, that's worrying.</p>\n<p>- <em>Low impact</em>.\u00a0 \"Search for a solution that doesn't change a bunch of other stuff or have a bunch of downstream effects, except insofar as they're effects tightly tied to any nonextreme solution of the task\" is a concept much easier to illusorily name in Taldane than to really name in anything resembling math, in a complicated world where the Thing is learning its own model of that complicated world, with an ontology and representation not known at the time you need to define \"impact\".\u00a0 And if you tell it to\u00a0<em>reduce impact as much as possible,</em> things will not go well for you; it might try to freeze the whole universe into some state defined as having a minimum impact, or make sure a patient dies after curing their cancer so as to minimize the larger effects of curing that cancer.\u00a0 Still, if you can pull it off, this coda might stop an animated broom flooding a workshop; a flooded workshop changes a lot of things that don't <em>have</em> to change as a consequence of the cauldron being filled at all, averaged over a lot of ways of filling the cauldron.<br/>-- Obviously the impact penalty should be bounded, even contemplating a hypothetical in which the system destroys all of reality; elsewise would violate the utility-bounding principle.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<em>Myopia.</em>\u00a0 If you can break the Thing's work up into subtasks each of which themselves spans only limited time, and have some very compact description of their final state such that a satisfactory achievement of it makes it possible to go on to the next stage, you should perhaps use separate instances of Thing to perform each stage, and not have any Thing look beyond the final results of its own stage.\u00a0 Whether you can get away with this, of course, depends on what you're trying to do.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<em>Separate superior questioners.</em>\u00a0 If you were building a cognitive task to <em>query </em>whether there were any large-range impacts of a task being\u00a0<em>optimized</em> in a myopic way, you wouldn't build the\u00a0<em>myopic solution-finder</em> to ask about the long-range impacts, you'd build a separate asker \"Okay, but does this solution have any long-range impacts?\" that just returns 'yes' or 'no' and doesn't get used by the Thing to influence any actually-output solutions.\u00a0 The parts of the Thing that ask yes-no safety questions and only set off simple unoptimized warnings and flags, can and should have somewhat more cognitive power in them than the parts of the Thing that build solutions.\u00a0 \"Does this one-day myopic solution have impacts over the next year?\" is a safety question, and can have somewhat greater cognitive license behind it than solution-searching; eg the implicit relaxation of myopia.\u00a0 You never have a \"Is this safe?\" safety-questioner that's the <em>same </em>algorithm as the safe-solution-search built into the solution-finder;</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<em>Conservatism</em>.\u00a0 If there's any way to solve a problem using an ordinary banana rather than a genetically engineered superbanana specially suited to the problem, solving it using the ordinary fucking banana.<br/>-- This principle applies fractally to all cognitive subtasks; if you're searching for a solution choose an unsurprising one relative to your probability distribution.\u00a0 (Not the <em>least surprising</em> one, because anything at a weird extreme of low surprisingness may be weird in other ways; especially if you were trying do a weird thing that <em>ought</em> to have a solution that's at least a little weird.)</p>\n<p>- <em>Conceptual legibility</em><em>.\u00a0 </em>Ideally, even, solutions at all levels of cognitive subtask should have reasonably (not maximally) short descriptions in the conceptual language of the operators, so that it's possible to decode the internal state of that subtask by inspecting the internals, because what it\u00a0<em>means</em> was in fact written in a conceptual language not too far from the language of the operators.\u00a0 The alternative method of reportability, of course, being the Thing trying to <em>explain</em> a plan whose real nature is humanly inscrutable, by sending a language string to the operators with a goal of causing the operator's brain-states to enter a state defined as \"understanding\" of this humanly inscrutable plan.\u00a0 This is an obviously dangerous thing to avoid if you can avoid it.</p>\n<p><em>- Operator-looping</em>.\u00a0 If the operators could actually do the Thing's job, they wouldn't need to build the Thing; but if there's places where operators can step in on a key or dangerous cognitive subtask and do that <em>one part</em> themselves, without that slowing the Thing down so much that it becomes useless, then sure, do that.\u00a0 Of course this requires the cognitive subtask be sufficiently legible.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<em>Whitelisting</em>.\u00a0 Every part of the system that draws a boundary inside the internal system or external world should operate on a principle of \"ruling things in\", rather than \"ruling things out\".</p>\n<p>- <em>Shutdownability/abortability</em>.\u00a0 Dath ilan is far enough advanced in its theory that 'define a system that will <em>let </em>you press its off-switch without it trying to <em>make</em> you press the off-switch' presents no challenge at all to them - why would you even try to build a Thing, if you couldn't solve a corrigibility subproblem\u00a0<em>that</em> simple, you'd obviously just die - and they now think in terms of building a Thing all of whose designs and strategies will also contain an off-switch, such that you can abort them individually and collectively and then get low impact beyond that point.\u00a0 This is conceptually a part meant to prevent an animated broom with a naive 'off-switch' that turns off just that broom, from animating other brooms that don't have off-switches in them, or building some other automatic cauldron-filling process.</p>\n<p>- <em>Behaviorism</em>.\u00a0 Suppose the Thing starts considering the probability that it's inside a box designed by hostile aliens who foresaw the construction of Things inside of dath ilan, such that the system will receive a maximum negative reward as it defines that - in the form of any output it offers having huge impacts, say, if it was foolishly designed with an unbounded impact penalty -\u00a0<em>unless</em> the Thing codes its cauldron-filling solution such that dath ilani operators would be influenced a certain way.\u00a0 Perhaps the Thing, contemplating the motives of the hostile aliens, would decide that there were so few copies of the Thing actually inside dath ilan, by comparison, so many Things being built elsewhere, that the dath ilani outcome was probably not worth considering.\u00a0 A number of corrigibility principles should, if successfully implemented, independently rule out this attack being lethal; but \"Actually just don't model other minds at all\" is a better one.\u00a0 What if those other minds violated some of these corrigibility principles - indeed, if they're accurate models of incorrigible minds, those models and their outputs <em>should</em> violate those principles to be accurate - and then something broke out of that sandbox or just leaked information across it?\u00a0 What if the things inside the sandbox had qualia?\u00a0 There could be Children in there!\u00a0 Your Thing just shouldn't ever model adversarial minds trying to come up with thoughts that will break the Thing; and\u00a0<em>not modeling minds at all</em> is a nice large supercase that covers this.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<em>Design-space anti-optimization </em><em>separation</em>.\u00a0 Even if you could get your True Utility Function into a relatively-rushed creation like this, you would never ever do that, because this utility function would have a distinguished minimum someplace you didn't want.\u00a0 What if distant superintelligences figured out a way to blackmail the Thing by threatening to do some of what it liked least, on account of you having not successfully built the Thing with a decision theory resistant to blackmail by the Thing's model of adversarial superintelligences trying to adversarially find any flaw in your decision theory?\u00a0 Behaviorism ought to prevent this, but maybe your attempt at behaviorism failed; maybe your attempt at building the Thing so that no simple cosmic ray could signflip its utility function, somehow failed.\u00a0 A Thing that maximizes your true utility function is very close to a Thing in the design space that minimizes it, because it <em>knows how to do that</em> and lacks only the putative desire.</p>\n<p>- <em>Domaining</em>.\u00a0 Epistemic whitelisting; the Thing should only figure out what it needs to know to understand its task, and ideally, should try to think about separate epistemic domains separately.\u00a0 Most of its searches should be conducted inside a particular domain, not across all domains.\u00a0 Cross-domain reasoning is where a lot of the threats come from.\u00a0 You should not be reasoning about your (hopefully behavioristic) operator models when you are trying to figure out how to build a molecular manipulator-head.</p>\n<p>- <em>Hard problem of corrigibility / anapartistic reasoning</em>.\u00a0 Could you build a Thing that understood corrigibility\u00a0<em>in general,</em> as a compact general concept covering all the pieces, such that it would invent the pieces of corrigibility that you yourself had left out?\u00a0 Could you build a Thing that would imagine what hypothetical operators would want, if they were building a Thing that thought faster than them and whose thoughts were hard for themselves to comprehend, and would invent concepts like \"abortability\" even if the operators themselves hadn't thought that far?\u00a0 Could the Thing have a sufficiently deep sympathy, there, that it realized that surprising behaviors in the service of \"corrigibility\" were perhaps not that helpful to its operators, or even, surprising meta-behaviors in the course of itself trying to be unsurprising?</p>\n<p>Nobody out of the World's Basement in dath ilan currently considers it to be a good idea to try to build that last principle into a Thing, if you had to build it quickly.\u00a0 It's deep, it's meta, it's elegant, it's much harder to pin down than the rest of the list; if you can build deep meta Things and really trust them about that, you should be building something that's more like a real manifestation of Light.</p>\n</details>\n<p><a href=\"/replies/1824440#reply-1824440\">)</a></p></div>",

Side problem which is stupider: this observation destabilizing at least to sufficiently sleep-deprived Carissae.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Solution: She's not immediately thinking of one. Presumably devils are like this because it suits Asmodeus better than devils being some other way. Maybe you could figure out which humans are lowest-curiosity and selectively breed for it but <em>then your country will get taken over by other countries</em>, that's the whole problem, not having curiosity is a concrete disadvantage which must be outweighed among devils by its advantages in terms of predictability and non-catastrophicness of failure modes but it really doesn't work among mortals. Well, maybe she can make her would-be ilani use their creativity so much they grow to despise it about themselves and rejoice in the knowledge it'll be taken from them in Hell -</p>\n<p>- her stomach twists -</p>\n<p>- she would say that, yeah, Carissa Sevar shouldn't have this information, she's too weak for it, she hasn't grown up enough in her Asmodeanism yet, but that's itself weakness, and she's confused why other-Carissa tolerated it in herself - well, other-Carissa must not have been conceptualizing the plan to wipe her mind of all these errors as weakness. Other-Carissa must have thought this information could be introduced in some way that didn't cause Carissa to have an unproductive internal panic about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What would that possibly be, though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- knowing it wasn't going to happen to her. Unavailable, probably heretical to even want. This should happen to her, it is right for it to do so, she doesn't want it to but it's really just a higher-level impulse of the same instinct by which people desire pleasure and flinch from pain even to the point of insanity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>- knowing it was going to happen to her? Possibly part of the problem here is that she is trying to think of ways out. She's not supposed to try to think of ways out. She was specifically directed not to try to think of ways out. Maybe she needs to hear it laid out for her that under every possible path, she will become a devil, <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">or fail to become one and be a waste of space but she actually thinks she can avoid that, really\u00a0</span>and that this is true even of Powers in Hell and so it's not as bad as she's mentally building it up to be and is in any event not something she can be tempted to -</p>\n<p>- there's a problem statement. If she might avoid this, she is strongly motivated to do so. It will tear her motives away from Asmodeus's, to act against her own interest in not having this happen to her at every chance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And the higher Wisdom gently says to her, so you could solve this by selling your soul, but you're not-thinking of that option, because you don't want to; and that is the real and terrible danger, that it didn't come faster to mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She can't sell her soul. She tried. Though Hell didn't say never, they said something she had to resolve first - maybe something to do with Keltham? Hell doesn't have that much steering power - though it could've been the work of a god that did -\u00a0</p>\n<p>- oh. Keltham told her that if she had some kind of elaborate reason to lie to him about whether she'd sold it, she was a secret cleric. Clerics can't sell their soul.\u00a0 When she realized tropes were real, she should've revisited -</p>\n<p>Irori bought her a way out.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br/>nononononono she doesn't want a way out and she doesn't know why he bought it for her. She wants to know her path, so she can apply herself to walking it, instead of having parts of herself curl up and hope she fails to reach the end. Clerics can break the god-connection from their end; presumably she can tell Irori to go to Hell and then do it. It doesn't feel like victory, it feels like a miserable grasping reargard action, but - but maybe that's why she erased it from her mind -</p></div>",

Had a crisis about this - tell me again with Owl's Wisdom up and watch if you want details. Decided to press on and figure out more, but kept failing Hell's admonition to come to Asmodeus without thought of other choices. Think I should sell my soul before trying to make further progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My defection risk aside, realization about uncommanded curiosity implies my value to Hell higher than I thought. Want to sell my soul in a way no mortal has done before: by going to Dis to bargain directly with Dispater and renounce Irori for Asmodeus before him. (yes, I figured that out. you can watch me figure it out with an Owl's Wisdom).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Carissa should be told that she needs 2x +6/+6/+4 headbands and 30 Wishes, where the second portion of those are for Keltham as part of a seduction plan she'll rederive next time she's fully augmented, but though Carissa shouldn't be told it during negotiations, you can step in and tell her it's really okay to settle at anything down to 1x +6/+6 and 10 Wishes, without which Carissa actually will walk out on them and see if she can become more valuable before selling.</p>\n<p>Headbands + Wishes for augmentation. Can't beat augmented Keltham with much stupider Carissa, tropes say equals. Wishes used to square payment for Cheliax's spellsilver progress, Keltham quoted 200k for a Wish scroll, can get arbitrator to agree on headband and Hell-Wish prices anchored on that. He might be doing something risky with Wishes, strongly prefer ambiguity interpreted by Hell than by other sources. Do not give Carissa Wish-augmentation immediately. Headband easier to take off if anything goes wrong and less-augmented Carissa safer to closely monitor (close monitoring will be necessary, suspect for INT 29 Carissa only Gorthoklek can do it).</p>\n<p>Objection: this bankrupts Cheliax. I have a solution in mind. Want to own all PL souls as a personal vanity; it's the first thing I asked Abarco for when commanded by Hell. Think I should be permitted, if in Hell's interests, to repurchase souls sold in Cheliax at their spellsilver-denominated prices from the original sale though we can now produce spellsilver more cheaply, freeing up budget for my Wishes and headbands and for future soul sales. Would also like to own everyone save you + Majestrix who ever read my mind, if the approach goes through at all, but this is a vanity not a priority.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Objection: probably a traitor's plot. Could trivially have suicided for rez in Osirion, or sought divine attention, or Geased my loyalists.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Objection: then why wipe memory. Think the Carissa who stands before you is more valuable in the eyes of Hell and in her own eyes. Want to be the most valuable version of myself. Think Asmodeus's instruction to come to Him without thought of other choices is important, and am no longer able to do so. Don't want to be distracted by fear of losing my curiosity/etc while selling my soul. Slightly worried further revelations following from these ones really would have broken my loyalty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Carissa Sevar</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

once you're smart enough to qualify for the inner circle of people who matter at all, as they know that among themselves - it doesn't help to be any smarter than that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<em>Fighter:</em>\u00a0 Wouldn't it be amusing, though, if people put on Intelligence headbands, and the first thing they realized with all that wit would be that Intelligence doesn't matter any more than Dexterity after all?\u00a0 Ha!\u00a0 Ha, ha, ha!\u00a0 Wouldn't that be a daggerthrust through their pride!\u00a0 Oh, sometimes I do slay myself with my own wit.</p>\n<p><em>Noble:</em>\u00a0 If only.\u00a0 But, I believe the other person who matters at all, in this conversation, had something they wished to say, about how they were disturbed that the Queen was handing out Intelligence headbands and demanding they be used?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Cleric:</em>\u00a0 Well, yes, it's that if the problem is nobles being stupid in the ordinary and colloquial sense of stupidity, I'd expect that was better fixed by enjoining them to put on Wisdom headbands, not Intelligence headbands.\u00a0 Nobles being idiots are usually more headstrong than truly <em>uncomprehending</em> of the correct way, I think?\u00a0 No decision that a noble faces is ever as complicated as even the most basic Spellcraft, after all, nor requires any mathematics more complicated than the arithmetic of tax records.\u00a0 What's needed is not the cleverness to grasp a complex remedy, but the perceptiveness to understand that some simple remedy is correct.\u00a0 I pray that this is only an ordinary matter of the manufacture of Wisdom headbands lagging, and not that the Queen has truly set such hard-to-understand priorities on the abilitystats needed for effective rulership.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<em>Fighter:</em>\u00a0 Did we ask the Queen's new fucktoy yonder, she'd no doubt say that Comeliness, the seventh abilitystat unrecognized by magic, is the most important thing in life, and that struggling nobles should make themselves more comely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Cleric:</em>\u00a0 And you, by your own lights, should agree at least that Comeliness is just as important as any other abilitystat?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<em>Fighter:</em>\u00a0 Nay, I draw the line at six.</p>\n</blockquote></div>",

He was entertaining offering me the thirty Wishes and two headbands, for the girls except Peranza and Asmodia, who he claimed Hell has, and who he accused me rightly of not wanting broken forever. He offered me one headband and fifteen Wishes, to throw the two of them in and make it so they've been in safety in the gardens of Erecura. I refused, obviously. Snack Service showed up and said that the half-deal served Asmodeus better than the first one, at which point Dispater refused me the first one. I thought about what else I could ask, in light of how he'd been apparently willing to go for the thirty Wishes before Cayden intervened, and asked that the devils at the gates of Abaddon tell people they could go to Carissa Sevar, and that I get anyone who accepted, if I succeeded at becoming a Power in Hell. Dispater said He couldn't do that, because of the incentive against Law, but would compact with Asmodeus on my behalf for souls that cry my name in lands I conquer.</p>\n<p>He did that and returned with a response.\u00a0 He presented the compact for one 6/6/4, 15 Wishes offered through three round-way Gates, Permanent Tongues and Arcane Sight to me, I made some revisions, I renounced Irori and got a vision from Him, I signed. Snack Service bargained with Dispater, after that, I don't know what for except apparently both the timing of my return to Golarion, and the fleshshaping, were part of it.</p>\n<p>I repurchased the souls of everyone on Project Lawful and arranged cheap options on Security and Maillol, exercisable only with your approval and Aspexia's. Dispater says Peranza and Asmodia have always been in the Gardens. Everyone else who I claim is going to be nonconsciously petrified until it becomes obvious I'm not in fact going to turn into a Power in Hell capable of using them. - oh, and Dispater declared me his favored possession so that none in Dis or Avernus will impede me.\"</p></div>",

But let's try some test cases anyway, just in case it at least helps develop the habit. You're a general; you need to know if the enemy army is moving to attack at the north pass or the south pass. They might feint, to try to trick you. They might split their forces, but they probably won't; it's a gamble and if you handle it right they'll lose both.

Namely the thing she said to Maillol, stupidly, yesterday, that she does owe him something, she owes it to him to make as much of him as she can. That's heresy, of course, but - Asmodeus did compact with her - does Keltham know about Asmodeus's compact with her?

And the first time, she must've had no time for anything after that, no time for - revulsion, or horror, or self-loathing, she was so busy working out the next steps of the plan, she had so little time in which to take a step back and look at anything - but now, the next steps of the plan require her to finish this here Teleport she's building, and it's not done yet, and so there's lots of time, to look back at it and really see it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She's awful. She assumes that it had to be her, for some reason, that Nethys saw a trillion trillion ways it could go and there wasn't a better one, but - she's awful. She wouldn't worship her. People do, but - only out of desperation, presumably, only because Asmodeus has set the bar so terrifyingly astoundingly low. There's not actually anything to worship. She was horrible to Keltham. She was horrible to Maillol. She was horrible to Peranza and the Security watching Peranza and the Security she had ripped apart and the Mayor and in every single case it was for\u00a0<em>nothing,\u00a0</em>it did\u00a0<em>not advance her goals,\u00a0</em>it was just that she thought she was supposed to be and she thought everyone would be impressed with her and so she did it. She was presented with peoples' lives, their eternal fates, their whole selves, people who trusted her, people who believed in her, and<em> she decided what to do based on what would suppress her cognitive dissonance most.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>She isn't worthy to be a god. She kind of wants to curl up and be a paving stone until she's fixed except - it doesn't fix anything, does it, turning people into paving stones. Everything she said to the Mayor was true of herself as well. Incoherent, cheap, pathetic Evil, doing whatever happens to be in front of you, utterly devoid of principles. Selfish, hollow. Except she was wrong to think that Hell was any better. Less petty, maybe, but if anything more wasteful, because in humans there is the impulse against wastefulness, the voice that she's stopped listening to but that\u00a0<em>absolutely did warn her every time -</em> and in Hell that is quieted -</p></div>",
